WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE'D LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKEN BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIC OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANINGS
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M FULLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
<unk>NS<unk> SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE COMMON AND AT
I AM NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM DYING
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT SAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
WHO IT MATTERS A LOT
I SAID WHAT YOU NEED
YOUR JOB IS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY YOU
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
BLOCKS HAPPENS
WELL YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERPRISON
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN THIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE FROM US
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WE'RE TO HEAT THESE COWS
THEY'RE NOT BEING SHIPPED UP HETER
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL BUT
IT'S A MODEL THAT THEY
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THOSE
IT'S TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE GALAXY
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED AT HOME
AND THAT'S SURE WHAT IT WAS
WELL ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE ANGIBRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FEMININE CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBE AFTER THE TRANSPLANT
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE FREE THOUGHTS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NT JUST HARD OF THE SAME FRECIES W
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME NAMES BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUO TO THIS
THAT'S JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATIONALISTICAL
THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THAT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL FOOD
OR DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE METHOD DIES
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND THEN AT 11 A CLUB THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
OUR MOST PROFESSOR WERE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WANT
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUTRAGE PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
THIS IS COMPLETELY DESIRE
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP CITY HALL
I'M NOT A MILITARY BROTHERING
THEY SIGNED UP BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOME FROM BENGE
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER TO
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL FLIGHT
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WERE CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
AND SHE FIND THE GOLD
I CAN MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WORTH SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WON THE GAME
SO MEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LUCK
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU SAW HIM AGAIN
WE DON'T USE AUDIO WE DON'T USE VIDEO
HOW ARE YOU
THE VOICE REMINDED ME OF HOME
I DIDN'T WANT TO
I SAID IN ARABIS
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GET TO DO THAT
THEY HAD HIT THE JACK POT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND THE
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORRIBLE DISEASES
WHAT ABOUT FOLIO
LET'S COME BACK
WOMEN'S EVER STUDIED UP BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THE MAN
IT HAS TO STOP THE
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SURFACE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE ISSUING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY I
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
HOW SAD ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE A TRIVIAL MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
<unk>NS<unk> STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
THESE STORIES ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH SHELLING
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE CREATES THESE RARE GAME CHANGERS REQUIRES YOU TO FALL OFF AT LEAST
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT IS
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL WAYS THROUGH IT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG
WE'VE GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO CELEBRATE
YOU'RE RECKONED BY LITTLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT ARE CONTRADICTIONS
OTHERWHITE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB GITAL TO BE HONEST
HE WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
THIS IS THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE'S LAW TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
OTHER WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO IF THEY WON'T GO FOR A WALK THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T SEE IT
HE WAS HIDE AND CLOSET
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOUR JOB GETS OUTSIDE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DOG IS GETTING
HIS NAME IS WANNIE PATH AND HE'S A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATIONS
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A BEAR
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR ON TERROR
YOU DON'T GET CHANCED TO MESS IT OFF
ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS THAN
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS PENN I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BACKDOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAN REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE YOUTH
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATIONS
SO THAT'S MOBILE MANIPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FUNDAMENT QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN THROUGH A WORKFORCE
I TAGGED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
WHO WROTE THAT
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
THE KEY HERE REALLY OF KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD A NEW THING SOMETIMES
AND BOOR THEY WERE LIKE WHAT
HOW YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
IT'S ALMOST BECOMING THE SAME TAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD USE
THIS IS WHAT I'M FULL TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESIONS
DID YOU HEAR HERE HAS GONE MATH
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND IT'S JUST MEANINGFUL THINGS
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS COULD MAKE FATAL SEX THINGS
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS AND LOANS INVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 SING EUROPEANS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR EXPERIENCE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO FROM ALL OF THIS
<unk>NS<unk> I'M 37 YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE IT
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT TO STAND THIS RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE DRAWING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY AREN'T WE SKIPPING OVER THIS
I WENT TO THE DEAM
BUT HERE'S THE THINGS
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
WE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHEN THE CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I COULD
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE IMAGINED
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLET AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 E MAILS
AND MY OWN WEBSITE
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW IT WRITTEN DOWN SOME WAY
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE LEVEL OF THE AGE WAVE COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WHAT'S THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
AND HE'S A BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT OF
WELL YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THEY GUESS THAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
AND WHAT IS THE IDEA GROWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
WE WERE ALL COLLECTIVE
AND IT'S THE REALLY OK TELL YOU WHAT'S THE GOAT
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON FOR SOME
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
WHEN IT'S 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
IS LOVE AND THEIR S FRIENDSHIP AND THERE'S PROTECTIONS
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW AND CANCER PATIENTS WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
COULD WE MERGE
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THANKS FOR ASKING AND
AND HE SAID WHERE IS HE NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RISK BACK
I'M A FEMININE BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMAN'S FEMINISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADSTRONG BILLIANT GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKEN WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT VOICE CAN DO TO BREAK A GIRL
I LEARNED TO RIGHT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST NEED SUCH BRAVE IN THE
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
IT'S FOURTING LOCAL TONS
IT'S A TOP FREDERICK
AND I'VE WON REBEL
BUT I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I COULD PACK THEM ON
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
I MADE MORE MONEY
THIS IS GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANTS OUR WORLD BANKS
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORIES THAN BACK
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
IT WANTS A TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SET
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
TRY NOT ASK ALL OF THE FACE TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THROUGH
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN IN SYSTEM
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOU'RE IN THERE
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATION THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
SO MEMORY IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE HOW MANY IN THE MID
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH SOMETHING AS WELL
AND IN THAT I NEED A CERTAIN OF MYSELF
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WESTPOINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
WHO A WALK INSPIRES YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WIND FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOK AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL IN
THIS IS THE ONLY PART THAT BATTERY BACKED UP
AND GERMANY AND FRIENDS
4 TIMES THE MESS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH WE
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO TOPPLE DICTATORS
I WOULD TERRIFIED
WHAT IS WHAT DYING FOR
BUT IF THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
IT CHANGED THE WAY WE TAUGHT
THE BOARD OF THAT
I HAD NO IDEA
THEY DON'T TRUST THE LAW
WHY DON'T THEY CROSS THE LOSS
IT'S NOT TRUE
THAT WAS ONLY WAY TO GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S THE VILLABLE RIGHT NOW
OUR IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT EFFICIENT
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPKENED WITH MY DA
MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED TO MOVE
I'M TRYING TO BE FOR A BETTER PERS
EITHER ONE IS SO HARD
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
IS IT THE RISE RIGHT PRETTY WELL
IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENT'S DEMANDING CHAIN KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST FRESHING POVERTY WIDENING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS PURPOSE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE AND DEFINE TWO PARTS OF THESE THINGS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT IT'S POOR VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMIT OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAIN TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
<unk>NS<unk> I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW I SUCCEED
I HADN'T BAYED IN THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
THIS IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAVE STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS BUT NO COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG I
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE AND NUTRITION
A DIGITAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
AND THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM A NATION
WHAT KIND OF RICH WAS ARE THESE
SOME RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE HE DID
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT DATA
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OURSE BOX
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING VOICES AND FOR MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING THEM
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RACE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ME ONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL FEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOTLINE
THE NAZIS INVADED THE NETHERLANDS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY VIV GUNS
IT WAS LIKE A STAR PRECKON YOU KNOW
I STARTED OPENING GONE TO
ON THAT'S THE FAST THING
I'M IN TUCSON
WE HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SET AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWN
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IS IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITINGS
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKS
FOR AFRICAN HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILL TO POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN HISTOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES <unk>LG<unk>
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULTS OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 PIECES OF NASHED THE EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD CROSSED THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW MULTIPLE PLACES BUT
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEARTS
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION FOR LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS CAN BE MENUS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ MANY SELF HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT THE KNOWLEDGE
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE THEM ME
WHO'S UP THE OVENT
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIMES
IT WAS A PALM
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR YOU
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVES AND ME
I AM TORNED BY YOUR LOVED ON ME
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IF THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
YOU'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORKED
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCORE
BUT THE PEOPLE FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO READ IT WRITE THEM
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKE OFF
THE ENGINE TRAILS
NO ONE ON LAND HAVE ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THEN THAT OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THE ANSWER
FOR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
THE SUPREME COURT IS FALLING WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE HOLY SITES
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAVE TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME AS OR A MICROSCOPE I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW HEMILTON WAS EVERYTHING MODICINE WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GOOD OLD FAST AWAY
FIRST THEY FOUNDED POLITICAL PARTIES
THAT WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
THE KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE BE NOTHING BY THE EYE
HOW FAR AWAY WOULD THE FINISH LINE
SOUL THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
FETCHES REALS IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
DO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WOULD JUST KEEP THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THROUGH OUR NOISE GENERAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROSELF
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WHAT AM I THINKIN
IT'S FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS THEY
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHALLENGE
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BRIMSTONE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
IN SHE'S LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO ITS DREAM LINKS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S THE COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING IS BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK AS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE THE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED AS I AM
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITOR THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS IT EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORDS
AND SALSAR
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A FRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AND OFFER ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVES YOU
I'M IN THE COUSABLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FIGHT
SHE GOT AT SUPPORT NETWORKS
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHT AND
WE'RE DOING OKAY
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SETTLE CIVILIZATIONS
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUDGLING THE SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TROPICS
AND NOT JUST THAT
BEING MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT REMAKE YOU THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED FROM TO DO WITH IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ON
IT'S A COMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIGURE AID FUNDINGS BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIN ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMANDS
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED FACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FROM WILSON FOR YOUR KIDS REALLY
WITH BROUGHT US TO THIS
WHAT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS IN A VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
DO THEY HAVE AGE FOR
WOULD THEY HAVE A COMMON COLD
YOU MAKE IT FLOW FUNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRED
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
GO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY FUTTING OUT DAILY FIRES TO THINK IT HAS STRATEGICALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
THIS ISN'T INFORMATION THE
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
HE WAS INCREDIBLY HIGH
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT HE MISSED ME
WE HAVE TO ANSWER THIS
BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF THEM GOT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN IT HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST ONE YOU WANT TO
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE FORMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO FOR
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO VERY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A COP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT LIFE
AND I GOT PRETTY INTUIT
THIS IS HOW STUFF IS MADE MEMORY
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USABLE
I WOULD CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
WE MOURNED WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIFE AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH GENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN THIS IS HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO HER BABIES
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACE WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE CURVES SPIRAL
TWESTERN BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRIVE
THEY WILL SIT IN THEM FOREVER I
OF THOSE SEVEN HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS
I AM PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
YOU'VE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE THEY'RE ALL
THAT WASN'T BEING AMP WE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TALK TO FARMERS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE ABUSED BY REAL PEOPLE HAVE THEM
TEXTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS FLASH
WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND TO THE DARKNESS
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN SEAT
IT IS NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO CRITICALLY
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED IT
WE HAVE TO GET QUIET
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAFF DISGUISED AS LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT I BELIEVE DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB IN THIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOBE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOW OF USE THE LIE OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
AND I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DAD YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT HIM YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS IS TRUE
I'VE BEEN ATTRACTIVE
I LIVE FOR ME FOR ME
WHEN YOU'RE SIX MAYBE YOU SEE THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL WITHIN THAT WAS IN FATE FOR ME
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
IT'S YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE HEAR THE CHAOS OF ALL
ALL THIS YEAR TERRORISM
THE SILENT MAJORITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENT
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A HORSE <unk>LG<unk>
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OK THEN WE COULD MAKE A MOBILE GAGGERED COUNTER
YOU CAN DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED AND DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTON MAKES NO FISH
AS AN INVENTOR I TRY AND TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY FOR
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A HOMELE SHELTER
5 PERCENT DAYS
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM HAVING AN EFFECTIVE ADVENTURE
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
SHOULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOLS SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEE
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATE BAYDREAMS WHERE I'VE WALKED ACROSS BORDERS
THE END OF THAT QUESTION IS VERY DEFINITE IN
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAFTY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY IT'S NICE THEY'RE POLITE
WHEREAS GIVING AND TAKING OUR MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVE THROUGH YOUR VALUES
WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS FORWARD OTHERS
THEY'LL SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INCREASING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO BE
I WAS STARTING A BIT INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S A FULL PROBLEM I'LL DESIGN BEING OFTEN DEPENDENT SOUP FOR ART
DESIGNERS ASPIRE TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
WHAT WE WANT WHAT WE ASPIRE TO THE PROBES
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OFF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE AND TRENDS
NOW AT THAT TIME CANVAS NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CANVAS POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF FAST
THEY WOULD TAKE A YELLOW STICKY AND THEY'D WRITE SOMETHING ON IT THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON A BORDER
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUBJECTS
WE HAVE THOSE SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OPEN AIDS AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
WE TOOK CANDON OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE POLITICATING TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAYING FOR IT
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARNOLD FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK TO
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISIONS
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IT IMPACTS SENTENCING
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL STAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION AT HELP
AND AT THE OFF OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY LIKED THE BASEBALL SCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE THROUGH ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST AUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
AND REMEMBER CARLOS
HE WANTED TO SIT WHERE HE COULD SCAN THE ROOM WHERE HE COULD PLAN ESCAPE ROUTES WHERE HE COULD GET HIS HANDS
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP ME
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICANS
I DON'T LOOK DIFFERENT I
I'M NOT SHORT
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY INTERVIEW
I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH THEM
DID I GET MY UPGRADES
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T THINK PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY RECOMMENDED
EFFECTIVELY THE TALIBAN CREATES A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO FORTH THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE DOES OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
AND YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS THE THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS THIS
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
DID YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PATH
THREE BILLION PEOPLE TODAY WITH CELL PHONES CAN'T ACT THIS INTERNET
DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS SUSTAINABLE
YOU HAVE THE BIAS
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT AND THEY ARE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKING TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
PARTISTS YOUR INTERNAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END OF SEE THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BIG OF BIG
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO STUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DATE FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER FUSS
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THIS
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES IT TELL YOU PISH THE MIDLIFE
OR A FIRE OF MINE
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
NO ENOUGH HOW MUCH <unk>LG<unk>
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T CARE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERAGE
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON TO BE GAVE RIGHTS THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRAP QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE YOU
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WEARS OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE HEALER IN A STONE AGE VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AN INNOVATIVE THEY OFF
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST NEED TO AFRAID MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS TO GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE THAT IDEA
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT CORRECTION <unk>LG<unk>
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORST DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
LIKE WE EVOLVE ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTACT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY'S MAN OR WOMAN
I WANT TO GO
I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE ARE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
WE'VE JUST THEM HOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
THAT I WOULD GO IN ON OCCASION
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME PUMP
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY GRIM MY ROSETTA STEM
AND NOW I LOVE MY FRIENDS
I'M NOTHING AND
AND THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANY MORE CAUSE
I HAD TO HAVE FAITH
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
THIS IS ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN'T
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IT'S SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE UP
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATIONS
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT TO BE STRATEGIC
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TASTE
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETITIVE ISSUE
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT IS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HANDS
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
SHE WORKED IN A BANK
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
HE CARES ABOUT FALSE NEWS
WHICH INTIMATELY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT <unk>LG<unk>
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
THANK YOU GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO WIN
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
AM I GOING TO PEACE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE BREEDING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER TERRESTED
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I'M HERE
AND I WAS REALLY FAIRY
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT THIS
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
IS IT ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING OIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW THE INSIDE OF THE ANSWERS
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE POP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS OF LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS I
I KNOW I DIDN'T
I COULD THEN THE NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AND MAKE THEM THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARED TO THE HEALTH OF
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WHITE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
ALRIGHT NOW WE
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND POOL AND POKE AND BOTHER <unk>LG<unk>
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
COME ON MEN
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU CAN KNOW MUCH
WE WOULD POWER IT THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY KIND OF CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY TO THE SALE OF SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
IT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH NO
WHY IS YOU BRINGING THIS UP
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TESTAMENT
IT'S THE DEATH WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AN AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I STUDY SHAME I
I'VE GOT I GUESS I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW I'M
YOU WIFE WEST YOUR
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO CONFORM TO FEMALE NORMS
I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS AN E OPEN STUDENT
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR IN AMAZON
THIS IS NO INSENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAMES
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR SHE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL HALASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE GOING OFF
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT UP
FAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
COULD BE LEVERAGED THE CLOUD
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANINGS
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LEFT
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A TIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION WHEN
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN A
WHAT DIFFERENCE IS IT MAKES IT TALK LIKE PURISHMENT FELT
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFERENCE DOES THIS MAKE I
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THIS IS NOT A PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND
ARE WE FRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GROW UP FOUR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW COULD I LOOK THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH THAT STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
THIS WAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OUT
AND WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WAS A BIT UNCONVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD FOR MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT FORD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS BUT INTERESTS
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT WE DO
WITH NECK MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
IT'S PRETTY COLD
WE HAVE THE PLANTS
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEM WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMEN'S DEALERS COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAIL TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP HOW WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGED
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONCASION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BAKER MODELING
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND MORE FLACK ADULTS
THAT'S YOUR BRAND FAULT
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S OLD
THEY WERE ALL QUITE
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAMS
I'VE SAID WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESPECTOR AND I'VE DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY THAT CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRET TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE'S AT A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN FOREIGN
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST INDEPENDENT MEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKCHES
BUT LINDA WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS EFFECTS
WE HAVE THE TOOL BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRONE A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THE INSECTS AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORK
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM AT THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IS ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS YOU
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MOM
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOTS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S A MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO EAT PEAK TO
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING HISTORIC THEN AT THE RECEPTIONS
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLUP ORGANIZATIONS
YOU KNOW THEY DO POLLS RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLLS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP GELS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WERE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROAD NOW
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SOCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO TRY ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I'LL SAY WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING ANY QUARTERS BECAUSE THE WASHER AND DRYER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THESE PRETTY STRUCTURES
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPOVABLE PROBLEM
THEY CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
SHE KNOW ABOUT NUMBER
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT PERSONAL
WHY NOT JUST LET BUSINESSES COMPETE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S NOT FUCKING FORCES
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT MADE
THEIR FEEL AT HOME
