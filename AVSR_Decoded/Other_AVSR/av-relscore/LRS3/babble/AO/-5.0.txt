WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT FOR THIS AND I GOING TO BE REJECTED
IT LOVES TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
AND HE SAID I'M THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND HE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT WE ALL
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TELL
IT'S USING THE PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEDIATE
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M A TOTAL SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE COMMNESS AND
BUT I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL DON'T BE SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
HE SAID WHAT WE MEAN
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY YOU
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR ANY
BLOCKS HAPPENED US
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND A MOTHER TO IT AND LOOK BATTER
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE AN OVER
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN THIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRY TO IMPROVE CROSS
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
THEY'RE GOING TO EAT THESE CARS
RELATIONSHIP THAT DO
IT'S NO QUICK SURE THAT'S
IT'S ANOTHER WAY SHOWS
WITH DONE AND RESEARCH
HE HAD TWO IMPERSONALITY AND
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
DO THEY ARE WORKING
SO WHEN YOU THINK HAPPENS TO MUSIC GALAXY
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED THAT ON
I'M NOT SURE THEY WENT
THE ONCE AGAIN WOMEN THAT THE ANCIENT GROUNDS AND NOBODY CAN SOLVE THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT THEY PROBABLY WANT
SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FAMILY CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON IT
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDY HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVEN'T BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE THOUGHTS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME VANITY
AND I WON'T MADE NAMES BEING KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I DO WITH
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW HARD WOULD THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FOR CARING FOR HER MOTHER
IT MEANS BUT
WE CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUO TURN
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST IN THE BIT ONES
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATURALISTICAL
THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THAT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
WHEN YOU THINK A GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT WATER VIEWS ARE
WE HAVE THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
BUT IT'S NOT COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE BASIC GUYS
WILLMANS CAN BE RIGHT PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIMENTS
AND THEN AT 11 IT CLUCK THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WENT
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUTREACH PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
IS THIS THE DREAMS ARE
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP CITY HARM
I'M NOT A MILITARY BLACK
THEY SIDE IT BECAUSE THEY WANT SOMETHING THEIR BEDGE
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLD FOR THE
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL FOR ME
WHEN YOU USE IT CRYING
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE IN THE CENTER OF POTENTIAL
HE'S FINE A GOLD
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WORSE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY MOVED THE GAME
SO MEAR WITH YOU
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THINK WE WANT
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
MAYBE THEY'RE SMART
YOU SAW HIM AT I
WE DON'T JUST HOPE YOU WE DON'T JUST VADE YOU
AND WHY ARE YOU
THE VOICE REMINDING ME OF HOME
I DIDN'T WANT TO
I SAID IN THE ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED FIND PRISTS ABOUT HOME
ONE PERCENT COULD GET TO DO THAT
THEY HAD LIVED THE JACK PARTY
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
AND YOU UNDERSTAND
DOESN'T HAPPEN REALLY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
WE TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK FORWARD DISEASES
WE'RE NOT ONLY
LET'S TELL THAT
WATER SET OUT BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THE MAN
THE PAST THE STOP THE
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WOODS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH IS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T SURE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE HISTORY WORSE AND ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY FOR
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONE WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
URGENT 9 SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
I'LL SAT ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS KNOW THE SECURITY IT MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
THEY DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW AND ALL SERIOUS IS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
WE DON'T DO MUCH SHARING
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT YOU CREATE THESE RARE DAMN CHANGES REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF AT LEAST
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT MEANS
I HAD TO TAKE YOUR ASS
I'M TALKING ABOUT TWO TRUTHS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG
IS HE GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE ADD A CELL BRAIN
YOU'RE RECONCILED ENLIFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLAST WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT A CONTRADICTION
OTHER LIFE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB TITLE TO BE HONEST
IT WAS THE CALL THIS I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PAPER DOLLARED
HE GOT PART TIME HIGH
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
IF THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T EVEN WORSE A LOT OF CONTINUE
WE'RE JUST NEEDED TO KEEP GOING
AND WE NEED TO HAVE PROBLEMS AND INDESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MATHPATH PROJECT ON THE TOP OF MOTIVATION DEVELOPMENTS
IT PRACTICED OPENED MY WORLD
SO BUT WON'T GO FOR A LOT THEY WON'T BE OUT OF THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T BEAT
TO WITH HIDE AND THE POSITIVE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN THE DOCTOR GOT DIED
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DOG IS GAY
HIS NAME IS LONNING FRAGILE THINGS ARE BETTER ON THE ECONOMY
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO TO HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TAMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATING STRESS ACTIVATION
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A VAN
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR OF TELEVISION
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT OUT
ONE OF THEM LOCAL NUMBER ON THE WATER
BECAUSE WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS SAYING LOOKING MORE THINGS I
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE HAD THE SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS MAKING IT WAS A
THERE WERE NO BACKDOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
THEIR APPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE LAW
WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT IT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED THE POINTS
AND THAT'S WHAT
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S A MODEL OF MANIPULATION
I LOVED BY THE MOROBOTS
AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FORMING A QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD TAP INTO THE WORKFORCE
I ATTACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I'M GOING TO GET ME A LITTLE BIT
HE WROTE THAT
ON EACH YOU DO
THE KEY HERE REALLY IS NOT
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN NOISE IT
WE JUST HAD A NEW THING FROM PROBLEMS
AND BOY THEY RELATE ONE
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
SO HOW WAS BECOMING THE SYNTAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD USE
THIS IS WHAT I'M FULL TO NATURALLY ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT'S OF COURSE CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
DID YOU HEAR HE HAS GONE MAN
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT MEANS TOO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
IT IS THIS REALLY DISSIGNATION
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS THE CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS THAT THIS WOULD THEY CREATE THE REST OF THEM
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED FOR THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS AND LOANS INVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 SIMILAR VISIONS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR PLANET
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH KNOWLEDGES
I WAS 27 YEARS OLD
AND THAT'S FOR ESPOUSAL
WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
AND ONE STAND THIS RELATIONSHIP
THERE'S BROKEN WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAT TO DO IT
WHY HAVE THIS GIPPING OTHERS
I WENT TO THE FAMILY
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHER WITH HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
THERE'S THE CAST TO TURN THAT ORIENT
SO WHEN TO CHURCH AS OFTEN AS OCTOBER
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE IMAGINED
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 MILES
WHERE ARE YOUR WEBSITE
AND SO ALWAYS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED BEYOND THE REALITY
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE VOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW HER WRITTEN DOWN SOMEONE
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
IT'S THIS QUITE TALKING ABOUT
LET ME INDUSTRY OF THIS
HE WAS A BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE A TOTAL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOTTER
WELL CAN WE GET SEVERAL THINGS
AND WE GUESS WHAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
WHAT WORRIES AN IDEA GROWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
WE DON'T COLLECT WITH
AND TO THIS PEOPLE WHO ARE TORRYING WHAT'S THE JOB
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON THIS
WE'VE GOT DONE THIS
WHEN IT'S 10 DEGREES FOR LOW ZERO
OF LOVE AND THERE IS FRIENDSHIP AND THERE'S PROTECTION
WE DESTROY ALL THE PHONE AMERICAN CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF HUMAN THERAPY
YOU SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
WHAT WE EMERGE
THAT'S ALL FULL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THAT'S FRESH IN THE
HE SAID WHERE IS YOU NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD NIGHTS
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THAT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION THAT DISEASE AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN THEM WITH FEMINISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADS HOME BRAIN OF BIRDS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAINS
SOME BOYS BROKE ME THAT I WAS SO YOUNG I DID THAT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO THE BREAKTHROUGH
I LEARNED TO BUY LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE THIS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE FROM THE MOST NEED SUCH BRAVERY
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
A LOT OF MONEY
SUPPORTING OVER PENGUINS
IT'S A TOP RETINA
THAT'S ONE RADIO
I MEAN IT WAS SO NOT BEING
NO ONE KNOW HOW I COULD HAVE GONE
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPORTANT TO ME
SO LET'S START THERE
AND THEY MORE LIKE
IT'S GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF ART GROUP LAND AND ON THE RIGHT BACK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW VOLUNTEERS WILL PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TAG EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
IT MIGHT BE TREATED
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY WHO SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED WITH THIS FACTORY
WE MIGHT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD AND
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I TRY TO ENGAGE IN PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS IN MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M THAT SURVIVED WITH ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THROUGH THE
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HIS BRONE WAS A CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOU'RE IN THERE
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSPORTATION WE HAVE TO BE SAYING TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
THAT IN IRAN IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE COLONY ON THE LE
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WEL
AND IN THAT I NEED A CIRCUMSTANCE
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO THE WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
YOU KNOW WHAT INSPIRES YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN DREAMS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
IT WAS WARNING TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE WORLD LEVEL
SHE'S THE ONLY PART THAT'S BETTER BACKED UP
AND JIM MEAN FRIENDS
4 TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE'RE KNOWING WHAT W
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO TOPPLE DICTATORS
I WAS TERRIFYING
WHAT WAS WE DYING FOR
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR LIVES
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
THEY WILL NOT BE THERE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE ROCKET SCIENCE
IT'S CHANGING WHERE WE TALK
WE'RE DOING THAT
HAVE THE IDEA OF
THEY DON'T TRUCK FOR LONG
WHY DON'T IT COME FROM OFF
IT'S NOT TRUE
THAT WAS ONLY WHEN HE HAD ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S A BUILDABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ANOTHER FISHING
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WERE
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED LIKE DOWN
MY DAD HAS ALSO EMERGED DISEASE
THEY GOT SCARED TO WALK MORE OUT
THEY GET SCARED TO MOVE
I'M TRYING TO HEAR A BETTER PERSO
PEOPLE WANT TO SO FAR
WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS AN OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE IS IT RELATES MENTORING
IS IT THE NICE RIGHT FOR THE WORLD
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENT'S DEMANDING CHANGE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE BASED FRESHMAN POVERTY AND RIDING
BUT RECIPE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTANT WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE AND DEFINE COMPARTMENT TO THESE THINGS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT IT'S POOR VALUES OF
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IF WE WERE LEFT IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HEATING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT FOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAIN TO TUNE OUT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SON
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE HIM SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY ON THE DISHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
IT WOULD BE INVISIBLE WITH CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T WANT TO SUCCEED
I HADN'T MADE HER THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
LEAST IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAVE STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE MAY DOCTORS' PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS OUT OF THE PEERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT HAVE THAT CHANGED ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE IN NUTRITION
THE INGENERAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T HE JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITEMENT
AND DANCE HAS CALLED THE REST
THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW CAN I DOWN AT THE BEACH
WHAT KIND OF FRITURE WAS AUDIENCE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU WIN
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT ME
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WHO WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTACTS
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DEAL
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT ANY GIRL TO PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURING BOYS AND TO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE FOR LOCK A ROOM AND GIVING THEM
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATING
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ME ONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL AFFECT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WITHOUT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT TOP LINE
THE NAZIS WHEN FADED THE NETHERLANDS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I WAS REMEMBERING WITH KIDS' FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY VIDEO GAME
IT WAS LIKE A STAR TRICK OUTSIDE YOU KNOW
WE STARTED WORKING NEW GONE TO
ALL THAT'S THE BEST
I'M AT TWO SONG
WE HAVE TO GO AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO AND SET AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWD
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IS IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL RIGHT
IT WAS FAULTING MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO BE STARTED OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICANS HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE AWARE TO POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN HISTOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 NIECES OF NASTY EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU IN THE PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM AND SOME SAY PLACE
THEN IT SAID WHAT DID IT HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES WITH
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A PROBLEM
THAT'S JUST A WRONG
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
WHAT WE'VE BEEN BRINGING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE WINNING
WE KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOW ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S OUT TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK ABOUT WHAT
I EVEN READ AND HIS HEALTHCARE BOX
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT THE WORLD
TRY AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS WE KNOW
I WOULD LOVE TO GET SOMETHING
LOSE A PIECE AND
WHATEVER ALREADY WAS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS COME BACK
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
IT WAS A POWERFUL
PAIN WAS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR HUMAN
I REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID TO MANY
I AM THINKING OF THERE ARE LOTS IN THERE
I AM TORNED BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY WAY
AND I SAID I DON'T MIND
WE'VE BEEN REALLY LOOK AT IT HOW WAYS IF THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING GOOD TECHNOLOGIES
YOU LEARNED YOU ABOUT HOW CONTINUE THIS WORLD
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCORE
IT IS USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN NOT A REALLY GOOD
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FANELS
NO ONE OF LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT I DIDN'T THINK NOT WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF THE WARRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT OR MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
AND THAT OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULD PLAY THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL NUMBER
THE SUPREME COURT HAS FALLEN WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE COLOR SENSE
THEY WERE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PALLIANCE OF MAYORS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN I HAVE TO BRING YOU AN END
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL WORK THE STANDARDS OR A MICROSCOPE I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOLS ARE
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING MADISON WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT INDIVIDUALS BACK AWAY
FIRST THEY FOUNDED POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY CAN BE
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE FROM
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE CANNOT SEE BY THE EYE
HOW FAR LAID WAS THE FINISH LINE
SO THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
BET THIS REAL IS A BOST IN
THERE'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
DID THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SEE
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THERE ARE NO CERTAIN CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST AN INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT BY CARRY YOUNG BAGS FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROSELVES
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I GOT ONE OF MY THINKINGS
WHAT'S MY HERE IS ALL
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV JOURNEY
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE IN BROOMSTONE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
AND SHE WAS LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING THEM
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LATES THAT TRIED TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WANT RULE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT YOU'RE RUNNING DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WITH EQUILIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
IT CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF THE MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK AS THE SEALER IN HIGH SCHOOL
THAT'S A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE A LIVING
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED AS I AM
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT HER WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB THE
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER IN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR ON LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORDS
AND SALSA N
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T WORRY
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND WE PUT ON AND OFF WITH ALL NIGHT HOME
THERE IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
WE DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVES YOU
I'M NEW POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW
AND WHERE YOU UNDERSTAND THEM
75 OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FATHER
SHE GOT AND SHE CAUGHT NETWORKS
YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOUR PRICE
YOU'RE DOING OBVIOUS
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS IN THE MORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE AROUND SOUTHERN CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE WANT TO LIST OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUGGLING THE SWIMBLE ACROSS THE PROBLEMS
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE COULD NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE START GOING TO BEATING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA OF
IT'S A COMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER A COMEDY BEFORE A CRISIS FROM WORKING
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIN ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT TIN I DEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACK EXTRACTING TECHNOLOGY FOR THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE THE SINCE WE'RE A GIFT REALLY
WE'VE BROUGHT US TO THIS
WHAT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF CHESTS AND A VERY SMALL PENCIL
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THEY HAD AGED
AND THEY HAVE A COMMON COAL
WOULD MAKE IT SHOW CLUMBER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL NOWARD CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRED
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SO WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I SHOULDN'T KNOW IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THAT
GO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUR DAILY FIRES THAT THEY COULD HAVE SCREEGICALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR MISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS ISN'T INFORMATION WE
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT BORN
THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE LIVES
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT WE RISKED
WE HAVE TO ADMIT SOMETHING
BOYS WERE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOMETHING GOT OUT OF THE ARMY AND ACTUALLY MENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS BEING AT ALL
I MEAN AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
BUT THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN YOU HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO
I IMAGINED THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE CHAMOLOGIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO WE'RE
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO TO REALLY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS THAT
TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THIS IS HOW STUFF HAS MADE MEMORY
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND MUSICAL
I WOULD CRAFT MY OWN JOB
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
THEY WERE MORE WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I REMEMBER IT WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN WHICH IS FOR HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN SHOOTED HER FACE
WHAT DO WE STRAPS HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BROKE TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN IS BREATH TWO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACED WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE FIRST SPIRAL
CLESS THE BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAIN NEEDED TO BACKLE
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS I WAS RUNNING DRIVE
WILL EVER SETTING ME FOREVER HOW
OF THOSE SEVEN KINDS OF THEIR WEAPONS
I'M PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
YOU GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT PRISON BEING ASKED THE
ARE ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TALK TO FARM WITH
CASMOS SPEECH DID SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EPIPHANY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE THAT'S USED BY REAL PEOPLE HAS SOME
TEXTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO GO ALONG
WE CAN'T RUN AROUND WITH A DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
AND IT'S NOT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO CRITICALLY
I HAVEN'T COUNTED IT
WE HAVE TO GET THE CHOIR
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY WELL THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRACK DISGUISED AS THOUGH ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT I BELIEVE TO BREATHE IN THE WALLSTROOM JOB BECAUSE BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
WE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE DEPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOWED YOU THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
HIM I HOPE BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT HIM YOUNG BIRD MANHOOD
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND WITH HIS TRUE
I'VE BEEN SHOCKED IT
I WOULD TALK TO ME
WHEN YOU ARE SIX YOU NEED TO DO THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS DOING WRONG BODY
HOLD I DIDN'T
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL DIFFERENT THOUSAND CASES
SOME WILL MENTION IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLAYING IT'S SO HARD FOR HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
WE WERE BORN TO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
THE YOUNG PEOPLE IS LOVE
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO
WE FEEL THE CHANCE OF WAR
YOU HEAR TETHERMAS AND
THE SILENT MAJORITY DOES NOT NEED THESE SILENCE
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A GROUPS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OK WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE BAGGER AT HER
LET'S DRIVE AROUND
YOU CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTON IS NO FISH
AS AN INVENTOR I TRY AND TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET ALONG TEN CERTAIN
IT'S SOME UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TUPOR OUR PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A HOLY SHELTER
5 PERCENT DAY
IT KNOWS THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM HAVING AN EFFECTIVE ACTIVITY
WHERE WOULD IT GO
THEY CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
CAN I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HAVING
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOD SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I'M NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEE
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES THAT MAKE THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATE DAYDREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY DEFINITE IN
AND HE SAID I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS BUT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR GRAPHIC PARTIES
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WAR AND FRIENDLY YOU'RE NICE BUT YOU'RE LIKE
WHEREAS WE CAN BE TAKING A LARGER INTERMOTIVES AND THEIR VALUES
WE ARE ATTENTIONS FOR OTHERS
THEY SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY WORDS OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTION THAT I HAD TO THE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
NO IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THIS GOOD PROBLEM OF DESIGN BEING OPTIMISM UNDERSTOOD FOR ART
DESIGNERS ASPIRE TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
WHAT WE WANT AND WE INSPIRE TO USE THE COLD
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET ON THE PLACE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVE
AND THAT MEANS TO FACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL OF DRUG CASES OF THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER OF OUR OFFICE ATTRACTED
NOW AT THAT TIME CANVAS THE JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMPAIGN RELEASE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A RELATIVE STICKY THEY WERE RIGHT TO BE ON IT AND WOULD PUT IT UP ON THE WORLD
AND ONE OF IT SAID WE HAD A ROBBING TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO CELLS BACKS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OPEN AIDS AND IT WORKED IN THE SAME IN JERSEY
WE TOOK CANDON OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AT THE MOST DANGER CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS AGREEMENT BECAUSE POEM SAFETY TO BEING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET THEY'RE CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY IN FORM
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARMOR FAMILIATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAN'T HAVE
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY WE'VE GIVEN THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT IDEA ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON THE NEW DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
THE IMPACT SENTENCING
IT IMPACTS CRIME ENVIRONMENTS
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY IN THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION AT THE
AND AT THE OFF OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DURING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY LIKE THE BASE HOST CAPS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT BAD SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO AN INSTRUMENT THEY WERE TIME CONCERNING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE VOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT ON THIS
YOU CAN TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUTION AND GO THEM TO WHERE THEY ARE
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
WE NEVER FOLLOW US
WE WANTED TO SIT WHAT HE COULD SCAN THE ROOM OR BECAUSE HE PLANNED THE STATE GROUSEWORK COULD GET HIS HANDS
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER IT TO HELP ME
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
I KNOW THAT DIFFERENT
I'M THAT SHORT
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FROM MY YEAR WITH YOU
I WAS LIKE THERE LIKE THAT
DID I GET MY UPSIDE
WE MUST ADAPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT COMES IN PROBLEM HAPPENED AT THE BANK
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND BIOLAGIC THESE RULES SHE IS SEVERELY RECOMMONDED
EFFECTIVELY IS A DOLLY BOND CREATE A COMPLETE BLACKUP OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND NORMAL AND DRINKING OR SNOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
WE JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
AND HE WALKED AROUND AND IT QUITES THE THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
DID YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HANDS AT WHOLE
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I'M LOVING FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT RATION
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE ASK
THREE BILLION PEOPLE PLAY WITH CELL PHONES CAN'T ACT SYMPHONY
DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS ASTONISTS
WE ARE ALL THE BIAS
YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE LIKE ME ARE ALL
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAIN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER ARE
PARTNER SURGERIAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END TO SEE THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE IS BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNETURE OF THE FOLLOWING IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO ABRISH MEN
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE WATER HAD TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO IT CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THAT AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH ME
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
WHERE I DOESN'T TELL YOU SPECIALLY MADE LIFE
OR A FIREFLY
AND THAT'S POWERFUL THAT
NOW THAT'S HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T CARE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERAGE
AND MOTHERS PRESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN THE GATE RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAT HAD EVER BEEN REPORTED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO HAVE SPREADS OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DEAD AN INCREDIBLY IMPOSSIBLE WORK
YOU ARE HEALER IN A SCONNING VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DIDN'T COME OUT
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
FOR AT THE SINGLE MOMENT OF THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITY IS COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND MATTER
I AM SICK TO MY STORY
HOW DO WE KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE BETTER
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST HAVE GREAT MY BRANDOTHER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS AT THOSE BANKRUPT MORE BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE THAT IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF THE NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
THAT WEAK INVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN ALONE
I WANT TO GO
THEY SAID OH THE AMAZON
MAKE YOUR CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYTHING
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES OF SIMILAR OTHER GROUPS
EVERY KID LED TO THEIR NATURE
YOU'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POPULATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WOULD TAKE A JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT CLOSE MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER IT WAS SOMETHING THAT'S SCARED IN HUMAN
AND I WOULD GO IN MY OCCASION
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GRATEFUL
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOMETIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY GROUP MY RESULTS STEP
AND NOW I WAS ACTIVE
I HAD NOTHING ON
AND THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WEEK
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANYMORE CARS
I HAD TO HAVE SENSE
IT WOULD BE A LAW AMOUNT OF PARK
IS ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS IMPOSSIBLE CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE DID REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL CAPITAL BUT LOCAL THINKING ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A CLICK SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKED TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE TAKE TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OF
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
AND EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON WE'VE GOT THE BEES TO TEACH
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY
SO AS THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE GENE
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETITIVE ISSUE
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND WHO IS THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENON
THAT IS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE THIS STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET SOME MONEY OUT
SHE WORKED IN THE BANK
I HAVE TO IMPORT IT
HERE'S ABOUT POSITIVE
WHICH INSTALLEY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
THINK OF A WAY
THEY COULD GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT CHART
AM I GOING TO PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREATHING BROWN FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS OTHER CHOICE
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEPREMOTION THAT YOU WANT DOING
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I AM HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
BUT UNDERNEATH SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
AND ABOUT IT FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG IN YOUR BODY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING YOUR OWN DREAM
IT WAS ABOUT SYSTEMS
BUILDING ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED PUTTING UP THEM REALLY JAIL FOR ME
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING ALL MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FIND THEIR BLOODY GUYS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE YOU PART OF OUR IRRATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SIDE OF THE ANSWERS
WE'VE NOTICED INTO THE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE POP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS INTERVIEWING
SO I WAS JOBS I
AND NOW I WOULDN'T
I TOOK AN AMOUNT OF PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER OLD IN HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL I GOT SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF WE'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME POWERS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED VERY MUCH TIME TO DO AND MAKING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARCE AND ARE HELPING
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WHITE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT MORE
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
EVERY NUMBER
YOUR BEAN OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW CAN WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO GOOD EMOTION
YOU WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH IN COOL AND COOK AND BODY FOR IT
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY AS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
THAT ONE MAN
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
WE FELL MUCH
WE NEED TO FOLLOW IT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU WITH
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FROM THE SALE OF SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA AT
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY WOULD YOU CHANGE THIS UP
HAVE YOU WASHED YOUR MIND
ON A FIFTH GENERATION TEXT IN
IT'S AN ESOLATE SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON THE AIRPLANE
WHAT DO WE DO THAT
I SAID THE SHAME I
I THOUGHT YES I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOU LIKE FASTER
I'M MADE A MISTAKE
BUT HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TODAY
HE ASKED WHAT DO WHEN YOU NEED TO DO TO CONFORM A FEW OTHER ONES
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE PARTIEST WORKING
I WAS A MOVIE OUT OF SPEAKERS
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTMENT IN THESE ON THE
THIS IS NONSENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL ALASTMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE WEIGHT
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING DIFRENT 
FACT IT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE A FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THEIR CLOUD
SO WHY DIDN'T WE EAT AN UPREACH THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED MY NEWS
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANINGS
THROUGH UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FARTHER
BEFORE WHERE SHE LIVES
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A CYPIC WATER
AND THIS LEAKS TO HOT IT IS
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I'M WILL MAINTAIN IN
WHAT DID THIS DOESN'T MAKE IT TALK ABOUT JURY SIGN FELL
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS YOUR FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFFERENCE DOE THIS EGG
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO PRIVATE
WHAT MAKES THE HEART WEAK
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T HEAR WHAT I WAS
THIS IS NOT A PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
AND IT'S WRONG
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO LOOK AT THE
BUT IT'S THEREFORE
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO BEFORE YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW CAN I LOOK ME DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED THE GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH THAT STANFORD
IN PHYSICIAN PRACTICING AND COVING ESG TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RATIONAL
THIS WAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
THEY HAVE HER SCANNED INSIDE OUT
AND WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WASN'T THAT UNCONVENTIONALLY
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT COURT MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS OF INTEREST
BUT ROBOT COME OUT OF GREAT SHELL
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHEN THEY GET
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING IT WORKS
IT'S PRETTY COLD
AND WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL QUESTION WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL THAT'S NOT WHY ABOUT THIS
WOMAN STAILS COMING UP
WELL LET'S GO ALONG ABOUT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
HE WAS BROKEN THE BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AT THAT
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAN TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP HOW WAS SOLDIERS AND TREATED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE
LET'S ALSO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL HER
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONTAGION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK TO THE CENTER
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BAKER MODEL
THAT IS THE RADIANCE OF
AND MORE TRY TO KNOW
THAT'S YOUR BRAND TAUGHT ME
TELL HER THEY BAD
AND THAT'S ALL
THEY WERE ALL RIGHT
SO THEY DON'T SAVE TO COME HERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
AND THEN YOU WORK TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU KNOW WHAT WE COME IN BY THAT
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I HAVE TO GO TO MY WORK TO UNDERSTAND IN THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE'S AT A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE OF FAR AND
YOU PROBABLY WANT
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST OF THE CAMEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKAGES
THE BLINDER WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A 10 YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BEAT FROM THEM
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENT
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRONE OF BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST BEWRONG AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORK
I DO BELIEVE YOU CAN FIX WHAT'S WORKING
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT THEY COULD BE EARTH BREAK
WE LOST VALUABLE DANGEROUS
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HEART NEW WAY
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMINGS THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
AND THIS WILL PAY GIVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT RIGHT MOSTLY
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE BOSS
I KNOW IT WORKS
WHEN I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROUTES
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TOO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A MOVING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB CREGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO EAT PETER
BEFORE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SUMMORT
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE TO PUT ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON TO SOMETHING HISTORIC THAT AT THE PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES ALIVE A PLACE CALLED THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION
NOW THEY DO KILL IT RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO GOES POLES
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP GELS
WE WILL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROAD NOW
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT YOUNG THAT MEMBER OF
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT PART WITH YOUR KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SOCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO TRY ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THE MORE THEY ARE
I WAS GROWING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I SAID WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING MANY CORNERS BECAUSE THE WASHER ENJOYER ARE FOOD
LOOK AT THIS PREDESTRUCTURE
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROVABLE STRUGGLE
THEY CAN NAVIGATE SPATIAL
YOU KNOW ABOUT COMFORT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST THAT BUSINESSES CAN BE
SO I COULD WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAVE MOLECULES AND FRIENDS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING OR TWO
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WOULD THAT AMAZE
THEY FEEL AT HOME
