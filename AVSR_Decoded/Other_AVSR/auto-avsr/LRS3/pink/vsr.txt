WE REALLY DON'T WORK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT TIME WORKING OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE LOVE TO HELP
IT WASN'T VERY COOL LIKE THIS
AND HE SAID ON THIS BED ABSOLUTELY NUTS
AND HE WAS SMILING AND I WAS SAYING NO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE ARE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IS USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
HE SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
BLOCKS AND ENVELOPES
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE THE UNIVERSE
MORE JUSTICE NOTHING SUCH AN ELEMENT IS ENOUGH
JUSTICE RESPONSE
WITH TWO OR TWO PEOPLE THAT EITHER SHARE OR IMPROVE TRUST
ABILITY GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE DIMENSION EXAMPLE
IN THIS HOUSE
IT HAD TO BE EXTREMELY APPEALING
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL
IT'S NOT A LUXURY
WE HAVE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
FEELING LOST IN MY HORMONE WHEN MY HUSBAND'S IN COMPANY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO ONE OF THEIR CAMERAS IS IN THE HOUSE
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED AND SAID OH
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
ONCE AGAIN WE BEGIN TO ANSWER HIM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
WHICH I DID THIS STUDY IN 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT THEY PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE A DEFENSIVE FAMILY CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS IN THE HEADLINES AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
THEY WANT TO CREATE THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDYING HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE SONS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIND
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME NAME THEM BECAUSE I KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUO TODAY
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WHEN THERE'S THIS SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NATIONALISTIC
IT WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAID THE PEOPLE WON'T STRESS THAT
BUT THAT'S NOT SO MUCH TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REACH TROUBLE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE BASIC IDEA
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCE
THEY'RE 9 11 THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO TODAY WITH A BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU STRIKE
I'M A PROFESSOR AND WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WOULD
BUT THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED FROM A LOT OF OUTRAGED PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE THERE
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP TO THE CALL
ABOUT A MILITARY BRAND
THEY SIGNED IT BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOME FORM OF REVENGE
ONE WAS THE BEST SOLDIER
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
THEY ARE CRUISING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WORK AND IT'S GOING TO DO THE REAL THING
AND THE WHITE INCREASE THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
IT'S VERY COOL
HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
BECAUSE I WASN'T GAY
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LAUGH
HOW COULD SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
IT MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT
WE DON'T USE HUNGER WE DON'T USE FAILURE
HOW ARE YOU
THE BOYS REMINDED ME OF HOME
I DON'T WANT TO
MY SON IN ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO GO HOME
ONE PERCENT YOU GET TO DO THAT
THEY CAN GET THE CHECK BUTTON
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO BEST PRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND IT
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORMONE DISEASES
WHAT ABOUT WORKING
LET'S HAVE THAT
NO ONE'S EVER SAID THAT BEFORE
WE KNOW THE STRESS IS BAD
IT HAS TO STOP
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SURFACE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU REPEAT THREE QUARTERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S AN ACTUAL COLLECTIVE ISSUE
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
HOW SCARED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
I FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE OF TRIVIAL MATTERS
WELL I WAS DEPRESSED
THEY TAKE THEIR STORIES
NOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
TRYING TO MAKE CHINA
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE RARE LAB CHANGES REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF A LIST
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT IS
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALWAYS THROUGH IT
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING WAS WRONG
DOESN'T GET BETTER
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN'T CELEBRATE
HE RECONCILEABLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WERE NO TRADITION
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S REAL JOB YET TO BE HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PARTS LIKE MINE
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT GRAMMAR GROUP
DID THE WATER STAY ON FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE TALK THAN YOU
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
FEET CRACKED OPENED MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WALK THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
SHE WOULD HIDE IN THE CLOSET
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOUR STAR GETS OUTSIDE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISERS ARE EXCITED
HIS NAME IS LANIA SHE IS THE VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION AND WITH FOOD AND HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF DRAMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING ON THE FLOOR AND YOU SEE A PILL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S A WATER TOWER
YOU DON'T GET US DOMESTIC
ONE OF THEM CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE THE SAME RESULTS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THOSE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THESE CHILDREN
AND WHEN I WAS DONE I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO PET TOOLS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMILY FISHING OPTION
I DON'T PAY IT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME PRETTY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DATA REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT HE'S
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGE BEFORE USE
LET'S PLAY
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S MOBILE MANIPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FORMING A QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD TAP INTO A WORKFORCE
I DANCE ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF HOW WOULD HE BE ONE OF THEM
WROTE THAT
I'LL BE TOO FAR
THAT HE CAN REALLY SILENCE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD TO DO THINGS SOMETIMES
AND POOR THEY WERE LIKE WHAT
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW TOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
IT'S ALMOST BECOMING THE SYNTAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS IS THE SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD DO
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT WAS IT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER IT SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
DID YOU GET AS AUTOMATIC
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AT LEAST THIS ONE IS CRUCIAL
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A QUARTER CAN FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS A FATAL RECIPE
AND I REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 37 CHICAGOANS INVOLVED ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED CITY DIVISIONS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF US
I'M 27 YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
AND WHEN WE CHOOSE THOSE WE ARE OFTEN SURPRISED
I WANT TO STAY IN THE RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WILL GO WRONG
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY ARE WE COMING OVER THIS
I RECENTLY DID
BUT HERE'S THE THING
I TELL I TEACH THEM HOW TO RIDE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT'S WHY BUSINESS IS A PROJECT
WE STILL HAVE TO DO THAT WELL
SO WHAT THE CHURCH IS OFTEN EXACTLY
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE MAGIC
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 E MAILS
BETTER WEBSITE
SO HE WAS WORTH ONE AND WHEN HE LET ME
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WE WERE UNPREPARED WE OVER FORGOT
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE SHOULD BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE DON'T CALCULATE YOGA
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
IT'S NOT EVEN SOUND SIMPLE
NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE SEAT OF THE EYE
WHAT IS THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
THE BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT AN ALTERNATIVE WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
WELL YOU GOT SEVERAL THINGS
THE CANCER THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY HAD AN OXYGEN USE METHOD TO ASK
SO WHAT IS AN IDEA
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
THERE ARE COLLECTIVE
AND EVERYTHING COMPLETELY OK WE JUST DON'T
THEY CHANGE FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
WHAT IS THE 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
THERE'S LOVE AND THERE'S FRIENDSHIP AND THERE'S PROTECTION
WHO DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WAS THE DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
TO REMERGE
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SO HERE'S MY HUMILIATION
THANKS FOR ASKING
I SAID WHERE IS IT NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGED THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE TO RAISE THE RESPECT
I'M A FEMINIST BY THE TIME A WRITER MAKES ONE
FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
HE WANTED NO POWER OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRINT COLORS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECT ANY GIVEN WOMAN'S FEMINISM
LATER YOU ARE JUST IN CASE YOU ARE BRILLIANT GIRLS WHO AREN'T THROUGH A LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO TO PLAY THE GIRL
I LEARNED TO WEIGH LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WEIGH IT AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MERCY ON SUCH BRAVERY
WE SEE THE BABY'S BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES
HE'S A TOP PREDATOR
I LOVE RED WINE
I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT IMPACTS ME
HE WAS GOING TO START THERE
I MAKE MORE MONEY
THIS IS GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANET OUR WORLD BANK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE NEVER HAD THAT EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING WENT WRONG
THEY WANT THAT TREATMENT
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
WHY NOT ASK ALL OF THESE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REASON HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THREE
THE GUEST WAS SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH PRESSURE HAS GROWN AS A CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULD JUST SHUT IT OFF
ANNOYED
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATIONS WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE DIDN'T SEE HOW TO DO THAT
DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE COMMON ENEMIES
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WELL
AND IN THAT I KIND OF CHOOSE TO REALIZE IT AGAIN
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO THE WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START POINTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WHERE ON THE GREEN
YOU ALL WANT INSPIRED YOU AND WHY
I DID BUT TO HAVE MY WOMAN FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED LIKE SLAVES
IT'S KNOWN AS MONEY MONEY
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY THAT YOU BELIEVE WITH
SHE'S THE ONLY PARTICIPATION PARADIGM
THE GERMANY AND FRANCE
FOUR TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE'RE GOING OFF
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITE US TO DROP INTO CELLS
I WAS NOTIFIED
WHAT YOU WERE DYING FOR
THAT IS WHAT IT IS THAT YOU HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
WHAT IS THAT
TO CONTACT ANYONE AND EVERYONE WAS WILLING TO PAY MY BILLS
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
BUT THAT'S THE WAY WE TALK
THE POINT OF THAT
THAT'S WHAT I DID
THEY DON'T TRUST THE LAW
WHY DON'T THEY TRUST THE LAW
THEY'RE NOT TRUE
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY ANYTHING DID
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE KIND OF THIS YEAR
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
JOHN IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST OVER DECADES
I WANT TO RETREAT TO OUR GENES
I MEAN SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY DAD
MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED SMALL
I'M TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
EVEN WHEN IT'S STILL HARD
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
THIS IS A GRADUATE SPEAKER
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST CRUSHING POVERTY AND WINDING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IN DEFINED APARTMENTS THESE DAYS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE'VE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
I DON'T KNOW
THE CHANGE IS THERE
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO UNDERGROUND
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY AND A LEISURE OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CRIMINALITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
I HAD PAIN TO RELAX
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNEW PLATFORMS I KNEW COMPUTERS AND THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WAS THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE AND NUTRITION
I THINK YOU DO CONFIRM
WHY DID YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
THAT'S EXCITING
AND CITIES GET MORE STRESS
THIS HAPPENED EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USES WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM A NATION
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND NO ONE ELSE WE DID
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT DATA
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF THOSE SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS INTO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND EVEN
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE IS THE ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT ONLINE
THE NAZIS INVADED THE NETHERLANDS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER EQUALLY AS YOUNG AS WE MIGHT BE BUT NOT
IT WILL TAKE US YEARS TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS HERE
I STARTED OFF IN THE CROWD
GUESS THE BEST
FAMILIES ARE FINE
WE HAVE TO SHOW YOU THAT
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOK FOR FOUNDATION
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A WRITER
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
NO I SAID AGAIN YOU WENT FOR ME IN MY BROW
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
TODAY'S VISION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITING
IT WAS FELT LIKE MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICANS MOST HAS FAVORITELY BEEN WILL TO POWER
HE'S IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FELT A LUMP AND A STOMACH CONSUMED CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHAT ARE THE PHILOSOPHIES
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S PUT PRESSURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK THOUGH I GOT 238 PIECES OF CAN'T SEE ME AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
IN FACT ONCE IT HAPPENED TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW IS THE CAMERA
AND THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE
THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
SIMPLY IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MIGHT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES BUT
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR POTS IN THE END
YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
AND IT TAKES A PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ MY SELF HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT HUMILITY
TRY IT LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU
LOOKED AT THE EVENT
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THEIR PRISON WHERE THEY WERE BORN AND THINGS LIKE THAT
I AM USING HIM IN THE FEAR
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
HERE IS THE PARTY
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FILES OF MY LOVE FOR YOU
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LIFE FOR ME
I AM TOLD BY YOUR UNFAMILIAR
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID IN MY LIFE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCORE
BUT IT'S USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO READ RIGHT
YOU BORE THE PLANE
THE PLACE TAKES OFF
THE ACTION FIGURES
NO ONE DECLARED THAT ANY INCIDENT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ABOUT NUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
THEY WOULD LIKE THE ANSWER
WHAT I NEEDED TO CATCH IS CLEAR
SUPREME COURT HAS FALLEN WAY DOWN FROM WHAT USED TO BE
NOW WE'RE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE HOLY SITES
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR TO
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF BEARS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW HE'S TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME UNDER THE MICROSCOPE THEY MIX ALL FALSE APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
AND IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING MEDICINE WAS CUT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY
FIRST THEY FOUND THESE POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL ONE MORE ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THEIR TIME DURING PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEE EYE TO EYE
HOW FAR WOULD I RECEIVE THIS DRINK
SO THIS IS NOT A SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL APPROACH
AND THIS IS HIS PROBLEM
MAKE THIS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
SO NOT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAYING BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MY SELF ESTEEM
I WAS JUST GIVEN INSPIRATION THAT'S MY JOB
THROUGHOUT YOUR HISTORY CAMPUS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE 5
AND WE FAILED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY ON BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROUSEL
IT'S NOT ONE BRAIN
THAT WOULD BE THE CASE
WHAT'S MY FUTURE
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DIVERSION VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOU THANKS TO OUR PACIFIC CHANNEL
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRING WOMEN'S NOTE EITHER
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
IT'S USUALLY AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT GENUINE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
I GET THESE IMAGES AND MY PLEASURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT DESK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF A MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET JOHN WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE A VEGAN
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHER SAID OH THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND I
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITOR THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB ONE
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORST
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OPERA ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
NEXT WILL MOVE YOU
I'M IN THE CRUISE SHIPPER RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FIGHT
SHE GOT A SUPPORT NETWORK
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHTS
SHE WASN'T DOING A GOOD ACT
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DON'T WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
NO ONE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE CHANGE CYCLE CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE SUDDENLY A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TOP
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY WENT TO DINNER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DO THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ALL
IT'S INCOMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER AID FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATING BACK AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE OR SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WHICH BROUGHT US TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SHE WENT TO THE PAST
SCIENTISTS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS IN A VERY SMALL PLACE
WHERE THEY HAVE
THEY HAVE AGE
THEY HAVE COMMON GOAL
YOU MAKE A FLOW UNDERNEATH OVER
ON SOMEONE JUST THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL JUST TO DO SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SO WE NEED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
YOU PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE JUST BUSY PUTTING OUT DAILY FIRES TO THE LIGHTS TRADITIONALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S CONSUMER CAREER AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HIGH
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHY DID SHE TELL HIM WHAT SHE
WE HAVE TO ISSUE THAT
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF GOT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
I HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO
AND WE CREATED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FEATURE FACEBOOK
I DIDN'T KNOW REALLY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THE STYLE STUFF IS MADE MEMORABLE
WILL MAKE TECHNOLOGY USEFUL UNUSABLE
I WOULD CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE IN PLAY
WHEN MORE WOMEN COMPLICATE
AND IT WAS ECHOES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH ATTENTION VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN LOSES HER HAND
ALL ONE WOMAN FEELS A TRASH
WHAT WILL BE TRUE IN OUR FACE
ONE WOMAN TRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO BORDERS
WHEN WOMEN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FATTEN OUR
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE ODDS GO
FACED WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE FEELS POWERFUL
UNLESS TWO BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO I WAS 25 YEARS NOBODY ELSE FELT SO I WAS READY TO DIE
THEY WERE THINKING OF FOREVER
OF THOSE SEVEN LEVEL WEAPONS
I'M PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT AN IDEA
ONE OF OBESITY IS THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED AT ALL
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS DEPARTMENT
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
YOUR GOOD FRIENDS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TESTING IS
HE IS A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE THAT'S USED BY REAL PEOPLE ASK THEM
TEXTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
AND WHY DID I REALLY HAVE SMOKE LEARN
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
IT'S NOT THAT ANY WOMAN THEORETICALLY
YOU HAVE IT ALL IN
WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DENIED LOVE WHEN
WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEAGUE TURKEY HAD THEIR WALL STREET JOB AND ITS BRIGHT SHINING FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE CUTS COME IN
HE KEPT WORKING IN THE LOVE DEPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DID SHE STAY
NO ABUSE IN THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT A GIRL WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR CO WORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
AND WITH MY HOME IN LONDON IT'S ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE HE GAVE ME A PICTURE OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT EACH OTHER SPACE
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
THAT IS THE NORM
ARE THEY ATTRACTIVE
FINALLY A POTENTIAL MATE
WHEN YOU'RE SIX PEOPLE YOU CAN DO THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL IN 10000 PHASES
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLAYING SO HARD FOR AND HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND LOOKING THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TOO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
THEY'RE YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE
WE NEED LAYERS OF WARM
WE TERRORISM
THE SAME MAJORITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENT
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OK THEN WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE HEADER COUNT
WE DRIVE AROUND
WE DIDN'T HAVE IDEAS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTER MAKES NO FISH
AS AN INVESTOR I TRIED STILL FANTASY AGAINST REALITY
NOW WHEN YOU GET THE ANSWER
IT'S AN ONLINE SEARCH PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATED PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA SOUNDS LIKE NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I CAN ALSO ACTUALLY HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
OR WE DON'T KNOW IT IN OUR OWN MACHINES
THAT WAS THE OTHER DAY
WHEN YOU SAY MONSTER
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECTIVE ANTI PAIN
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS IT ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
SHOULD I KNOW THAT
WHO WOULD I MEET
WHO IS RIGHT
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOLS SEEM TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
BUT LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SIGNAL NEVER TO MOVE
IT WAS SIMPLE BEING
IT WAS DARK
IT WAS THE SAME
THEY HAVE FACED ALL THESE
THINK OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WAS OUR JOB WE DID NOT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES EVOLVED THAT CHANGE DAYDREAMS OR HOW TO WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY INFINITIVE
AND I SAID WELL I JUST CARED SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS AND I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY THEY'RE NOT STILL POLITE
WHEREAS TV AND TEDDY ARE MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES WHAT ARE YOUR VALUES
WE ARE A TEST TOWARD OTHERS
THE EXAM SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO THE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTION DESIGN
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THIS IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF SEX BEING OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD FOR US
DESIGNERS ASPIRE TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
BUT WE WANT WHAT WE ASPIRE TO DO IS TO COLD
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
BUT THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE IN LONDON
NOW AT THAT TIME CAME TO NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST INTERESTED IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMDEN POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A YELLOW STICKY AND THEY WOULD WRITE SOMETHING ON IT AND THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON A BOARD
ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OLD DAYS AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
WE TOOK GAMES OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST INTERESTING IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DYING COURT
AND 67 OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARTHUR FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK TO
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THEIR MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IN MY IDENTITY
AND ABOUT CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUST AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION OUT
AND AT THE UP OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
SO LIKE SOME BASEBALL SOUNDS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT LEADS ME TO FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS DEALING WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER CARLOS
HE WANTED THE SON WHERE HE COULD STAND THE ROOM WHERE HE COULD PLAN SAM BROWNS WE COULD GET HIS HAT
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
AND I'M ALSO GOING TO HELP
AND IT DOESN'T
SO DONATION HAS REALLY SAFETY
AND YOU LOOK DIFFERENT
I'M NOT SURE
AGAIN THAT'S DISPLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY INTERVIEW
AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO ONE THING
DID I GET MY NUMBER RIGHT
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE TOOLS IN A SEVERELY REPRIMANDING
EFFECTIVELY THE TALIBAN CREATED A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE
SO MY NAME IS THIS
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE TAKES OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT'S A DEFAULT OPTION
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU MORE CONSCIOUS
YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS TO THIS
THAT IS OK
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHAT IS IT
WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE QUESTIONING US
IT'S TOO HARD TO REACH YOUR HANDS IN MY HOME
DID YOU GO THROUGH WHAT YOUR ESSAY IS COOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR I TOTALLY LOVE IT CRAZY
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THEIR PAST
YOU HAD MANY PEOPLE RUNNING WITH CELL PHONES AND TESTING THAT
CREATE TOOLS TO EMBRACE CUSTOMERS
WE ALL BE BIASED
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT THERE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE TO ENTER
HARNESS YOUR STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE ENDS OF THE CAMERA
SHE'S IN THE BUILDING
BIGGEST GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO STUDY EVER IN HER TESTING SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED CANADA WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO GETS THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATIONAL
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN IN RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES IT TAKE A VISIBLE LIGHT
OR FIGHT A FLY
AND IT'S POWERFUL
I LOVE THAT MUCH
IT'S MORE RECORDING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULD TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COMFORT
AND OTHERS REJECTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAY RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THAT THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD EVER BEEN RECORDED
THAT WOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME
EVERYTHING GOES FROM ONE SECOND
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
I KNOW THEY HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE HERE IN A SO NICE VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
AND SO IT WAS PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE CAN SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
THEY WERE NOT SPECIALIZED BY THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND PASSION
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THEIR BOXES TO WRITE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER AT MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEN HERE YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS AND GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BALANCES
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A YEAR PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
CAN WE EVOLVE ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN OR WOMAN
I WANT TO GO
AND I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES THEIR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IN IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
NOW I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE LIKE JAPANESE
SO WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT LED ME TO BEGIN WITH
BUT WITH NO INCARNATION
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND THIS REALLY WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
THIS BECAME MY HOLY GRAIL MY ROUTINE SO
AND NOW I LOVE LANGUAGE
YOU NOTHING
THAT I THOUGHT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OURS THAT HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY END ANY MORE CARS
I HAD TO HAVE FAITH
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
IT'S ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO READ GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 OF AMERICAN
HOW ARE YOU INFORMED
WE MAKE TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OF IT
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR QUESTION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
EVEN IF WE NEED GOVERNMENT WHY NOT WE'VE GOT SOME EXTRA REACH
SO WHAT I THINK IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT WE ACCEPT ON THE TABLE
SUSTAINABILITY IS A BIGGER BREEDING PACKAGE
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DIDN'T OPEN UP
AND WHO DOES THAT PERSON
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT AWKWARD
WHAT DO YOU NEED
IN MY CHILD
I BELIEVE THERE'S A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
YOU WERE STILL PAYING
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
WHO CARES ABOUT BOSTON
WHICH IS AT LEAST ONLY A THIRD CORRECT I MEAN
I DON'T MEAN LIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE IT GREEN
MAKE IT WHO WE ARE
MAKE IT THROUGH IT
WE NEED TO IDENTIFY WITH THAT BODY
AM I GETTING PUNISHED FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
WELL THAT'S WHAT I'M READING AROUND FOR COMPASSION
NO ONE BUT TO STRESS
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHETHER WE WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I DON'T WANT YOU I'M HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY'RE WORKING OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LADIES HAVE HONG KONG NEARBY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING ON A DAY THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT RIGHT
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
AND THEY'RE ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS RUNNING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THIS CASE COULD BE TRUE TO HER PURPOSE WHICH WAS VERY EARLY DAYS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW DEEP INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE GONE SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO AFTER WE CLIMB IN CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
I HAD NO IDEA
I THINK I'M A NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SAFETY HOURS BECAUSE IT TURNED INTO WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAID YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WHAT ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE YOU CAN GET A DISCUSSION OPEN
THANKS VERY MUCH
NOW WHY AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH OUR INTERNAL PAINTING
THEY ALSO HAD SHAVER TRUTHS
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT TWO MONTHS AGO
LOOK AT YOUR CAREER
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT ISLAM AND RELIGION
I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
OK
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY PAID
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW CAN WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET GOINGS BACK
WE PUSH AND PULL AND BLOW AND BREAK THINGS
HOW DO YOU FIX A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE PASSION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE ANSWER ONE WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS HIGHLY INEVITABLE
CHEMICAL MODELS
WE WERE GROWING
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SPEND MONEY
WE WOULDN'T TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR SALE SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT ONE POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YES
WHY DID YOU BRING THIS UP
HAVE YOU LAUNCHED YOUR MIND
I WANT FIFTH GENERATION TEXAS
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AN AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I STUDIED SHAME
AND I GUESS I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO CONFORM TO FEMALE NORMS
I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS A MEDIOCRE STUDENT
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY ADVENTURE ON AMAZON
THIS IS NONSENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
I WISH SHE WAS COMPLAINING TO A MAJOR AND HE SAID WHY
I GOT IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF CATS
GOING THE SAME WITNESS AND DOING THAT POSITION IS THAT
THEY JUST TWIST
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAY THE GAME THEY ARE DOING OUT
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT NOW
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
OR WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHAT DO WE LEVERAGE THAT
THEY DIDN'T EXPECT THEM BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED WHAT IT IS
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LOVE
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO HONEST
BUT THIS IS A SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
I WILL MAINTAIN
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THE BODY OF THESE CARNATIONS NOT FAIL
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WHAT DIFFERENCES DOES IT MAKE
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND UPDATE THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THE WIRE
WHAT MAKES A HARD READ
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THERE'S A TEXTBOOK OUT OF HERE
IN THE WORLD
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE
I WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOMING
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE IS NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GROW UP POOR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW CAN I LET THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORST
AND THIS IS SAFER
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTITIONER WITH CUTTING EDGE PSYCHOLOGY
WILL LOSE IT FOR SURE
IT WAS WHEN I WAS A SCIENTIST
AND THERE ARE SCIENTISTS AROUND
AND WE LISTEN TO OUR HEARTS
AFTER ALL IT WASN'T ME UNTIL THAT SHOW
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BASIC INTEREST
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
IT'S BEEN GOOD
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY EMBARRASSED THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THAT WHY NOT START TO WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMEN'S SERVICE COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD DOWN A DOLLAR FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S A LANE STUFF HAPPENED WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
AND YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAIL TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE KILLED
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF DANGER AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
GOT SIX BIGGER MODELING
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND THEN WE'LL LET IT GO
LET'S GO OUT FURTHER
CAN WE GO ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S HOME
THEY WERE ALL WHITE
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAMME
I THINK WE WANT
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I'VE DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID THAT 100 WAS TOO DARK
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE ABOUT OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST INDEPENDENT MONEY WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT'S NO NO BLOCKAGES
BUT LISA WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR GENDER MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORLD
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX IT WITH A BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM IN THE ALIEN EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
LIKE ALL THE WAY
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND PROFITS HAVE DELIVERING ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THESE
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDENDS
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST GET HOME
CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MOSQUE
I KNOW WHAT IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOTS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE INVASIVE A BOOMING CENTURY ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS TO EAT MEAT
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME WORK
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING A STORY THAT HAS A RECEPTOR
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
HE COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION
THEY DO POLLS RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO GETS BALLS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE SLIDES
THE GROUP SHELLS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
SO WHAT IS OUR ROADMAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I KNOW
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE A TRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU KNOW WHAT DAVE THE MORE THEY ARE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I WAS LIKE WHAT
WHAT ABOUT TRUTH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ANY QUARTERS BECAUSE THE WASHINGTON TRAIL ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRINT STRUCTURE
AS AN ORDINARY MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROBABLE TIP
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY SPEECH
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST GET BUSINESSES COMPLETE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND ACCELERATING SCIENTISTS TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WHAT I CALL VIRTUAL MORALS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING ORGY
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS THAT AMAZING
THE INFINITE GLOOM
