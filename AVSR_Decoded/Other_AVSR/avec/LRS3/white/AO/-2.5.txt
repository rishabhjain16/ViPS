and want to be part of that
i wasn't looking at the coubr that dn't me that idea
i don't know
i'm about there
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatment made them feel work
and i don't think do anything
so i looked for ponicra
what is that
what is to make the talk about dy find outb
what you think you say
n are m thing
i think that that means that people just pmit me what was inpron about
li should chans
the b might lied in a c
it wasn't like them to li tractic
1 could get to do that
i didn't want to
i an arovic
after college i definitely needed kind of face for he help
thav you the jack p
look at any the animal
i man the people people right now
wouldn't you have than me
you lk fect me
it feel obvious
and they put on and off to all my mind
that's what me f
and maybe understa m
i have an idea for taing the wall
we are now very comfortable imagining un imimaginable technological ai
kind of p anti reality
and it's hard and it taes courage that's why you' alive right
nobody comes to get same
how are we going to be that
so nck to that i was wking to
y jere
it to i5th day the poory of ld now wor campaign
if to be inpired
i ne a kid
you fed the guya the p
a 50 minch
that ispleely political n

in other words a corner to find the things a gift a year
what can we did now
l with 300aen mears lucky ix0dion
what do
thank you very much
and  surprised me by teaying you what
when you say allso stuff about myself
that allowed you to ticke a pic clf
this reoity is not vos and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i had survivor all fn perspectivies including fd
the thats what f on vy
i find the dayge people
and they often they can happen

but you did not relate tod
people tried to do the ideas
and that actually what happens
b this is it information
it's cheaper fal and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
whh is no tructure
a beginer with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what chinust f be like
you do f them howeverill heould they all
you wanted to or you should stand the  in and youould plan the fawrapt and should getis hand
and that's exactly what i need
you going to follow
we are to coming with us
we' alwaysry to make it profit
have the con time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get inportant
so it' is the demand that brings them to pfect
is no water
that we can analyhis to beonest b different
we take two to three times more than anybody else
l c back and do their equations
the thing of doing has got to be a frequenten
even if we get everybody's14's just to be theatent
so are other kre
but that's going to be a breeding that
i don't have a baby
et me give it a simple commercial example
more coust is not the intelligent a in his life
just is the response
because it's given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to into the class
you to s with a a defition
again in the car
thousand women choues connect to share their own chos tote and agon and chamge
i was hprified
what
and when she was complaining to her nure she said what
that's whatlthen doesn't ecriminate

to all of the thingame and need your first tp me
i thinel like it all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it is not possible
and gave h re thres
and you ha it every day
they are looking and looking and finding l
areire you
i ne't be a profit
that is hven barket
it's not compicated
you can't hide behind anything with other than your an pe
i c did i really have to know up
if noth they didn't want me for crit
you can't  goun around in the bght
what can i do about it
it's ready to happen without thinking about it
you'll never want to go
l's hold on to that thought for just for minutes
they' like a piece of junp mail and be thlown away
and you drop in the back
that he is a re re thouul
you guysould depe to the church to finding alling that
weould be part of the community to survive
we he about it 40
you all know differentcied at the end
is not to be a basic
i started looking at the research
about i5
i looked at my friend secnd dry thay writing upf more than a billion dolls for the
s very hard to make them part of our reactional deficion
and we we be having fun
but refidutions are growing and revicted its the meative fird
so we lost ourselves to the room to keat it and we try to grow what found us together
so re receected o
but it looks like what it feels like it look like what it fares valuese
propeciallyas when it come to find it fif
but in the process they eto frain of grave to fal in someody else's issues
bisness with a musan tomandity sa you look at a f but you probly want you
but very often you think about beoliful thing and defining and cart
so im talking you today that when i f is a much more p  recipe for you
a couple of years ago if you could have con kin it about decided that wereould a limit of what we could have conplened
so that's what i do
were havectu part the things people

they never have to bring it an e
but you know what the act backs are
but now it' just turned lound
i' take it to carity
my history didn't m
reaould we mion can of imndicate with others
my desire to disappear is still very powerful

we could only think of one way
we are talking about the day in which those public spaces where we come together
back int the real world and unless we find a way to delobilize democracy or
for any finationcial liter
look like thecle
they were arguing with one another about afric ech
to ree for' falling way down to what it needs to be
you can create as wor the poess of m
and are doing it together s
a huge opportunity a missional new potential for innovations for development
but the question you will have it
it will be invisible stratgy
the truth migration has become easing the inforation
and the change is getting more rapidly
i know i was one of the first 10 people i had the f1stear
but we have spent
when i was pann i didn't realize about living it was
my thing

you could it di turn it off
it came from the way in which theyaking w go
we in
we can see how to do that
thatct really important
but the second of the change the climate change we have to
and looking at that pattern
fire it and down one
that's sort of the state of the eye
now we want to do a double douil of the anght play coming through
and so they took them to feake pace
i understand how it could happen
and it thou what you happs to my face
youow the ha
and my way
and youid like than thk you
i'm not a professor with nothed about education
that roll weve bought one to me
bome on then
but there's actually more to story and back
you all will never want to happ
what different is how molecules are put together
effective the tharght about create a complete flatckup of any other source of information
that there is a so tool to have more resources to get them backan
