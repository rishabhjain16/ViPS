they want to be part of it
and they say i want to work in global poverty but what would it mean about my career
i don't know
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
we why is that
what difference is it make it they talk about joryign fell
well what difference does this make
now i will maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is good
the boys reminded me of a poem
it wasn't like them to misspractice
1 pcent who get to do that
i didn't want to
i said in arabic
after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
they have hit the jack hot
look at the endes see the animal
i'm in the prucial right now
what is the abstraction
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an ofpera all night long
that's what moves you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the world
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of the anti reality tv
and it s hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so naturally i asked what is effrican
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy a global malwar campaign
it should be inspiring
how do you know for sure
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply critical to our economy
and had to remember we had experienceed with this
in other words a corner to find these things because this is a fatal refugee
what can we do in all of this
roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 senior e picents
what do we need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i am going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
patriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
and guess what silicon valley
i've tried engaging people
and they also knew that they could tap into a workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people started contributing ideas
and that s actually what happened
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
out to dinner with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are
he wanted to sit where he could scan the room wh he could plan escap roughttle he could get his hand
and that's exactly what that is
you re never call us
it need to be able to do something with it
we always trying to make it faster
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to the tablees
there's no more of it
so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
we paid two to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equations
sustainability has got to be a precompetitivevicsion
even if we get everybody is working on it we've got to be strategic
so was mother t theresa
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have an overview
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it is given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
again in a car
thousands of women started reaching n out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
i was petrified
not a lot of hands
and when she went to complain to a major she said what
seual harassment doesn't discriminate
they just do it
say all look the same order a microscope i mean to a first approximation
well i think about this all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
and dance has progressed
and this is happening every day
they're looking and looking and finding lovees
how are you
i think this is a problem
fett' reels in boston
but it's more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like why did i really have to mo along
it's not that they didn't want me to critically
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mil to be thrown away
and you've broken your back
the key here really acknowledgeed
these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oilan gas
we need to be part of a community to survive
isn itt about a quality
we all know dep inside what the answer is
we've be known since we were babies
i started looking at them really carefully
is it about systems
i looked at my friends who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decisions
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lost ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
we we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its pore values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brain to tune out when somebody else's issue
this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening
well very often we think about political change in defines compartments these things
so i want to talk to you today about when i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limit of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just far of the same species
we're part of the same family
i have free thuns so i see how they fight
and i won't name names but you know who you are
we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
we've all done this
when it's 10 degrees follow zero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy
she suffered so much
there's love and theres friendships and there's protection
could we merge
the question why does she stay
which is why that i believe degree in the wall street job and his breat shiny future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological traf disguised as love one
he kept one in the glo compartment of our cars
and here's where those guns comome in
i had just graduated from harvard college
show abused the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
and when we are unprepared we overreact
they are not my children
and i did not know what to safe
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
on the other hand statistics thats a subject that you could and should use
so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11'clock they stopped talking about thesele issues
you can try it
everything in the universeth wears out
and that blew my mind
how cool was that
that's nothing special
again it had no choice
it had no choice
i realize of course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get a chance to mess it up
one of them got caued up in the water
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just say home
so we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that god knows me
who wrote that
i tagged along with my neighbors
i'll meet you there
and i said to myself i want to get me one of them
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
poy it matters a lot
hee said what you kned
he was a great guy
so i'm not saying that saying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your job needs to be challenging
the science is there
datid drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated fackage tracking technology from the logistic company that i work for
but we're not there yet
you see there's a lot of things you just don't have data on
with that you can actually trigger aid fundings the four a crisis can happen
it's a win all around
it's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world
and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demands
in germany in france
surely we know enough
four times the mass of the sun
we have to get quiet
youven't earned it
how can we do it
there's a flip side as well
it's shocking to realize that only 28 of american
i will not forget theday we got that text message
texting has a 100cent open rate
he told me not to tell anyone
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one's an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hot line
who's up the e theent
i can use it in my company
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
you reckonciies littlefferenes right
they supported me all the way through it
that's something we have to celebrate
h had gotten better
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something was wrong
the nazish invaded the netherlands
when i get out of this am i going to be a rejected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
we'd love to help
locks have names
we have no suspects
we took canandon off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
i ran the campon police department because of that
and all of this matters greatly because public safety to me is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decisions
and at the off other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
it impacts sentencing
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenpon
it impacts crime and violence
some people call it dada science
and one of them said we had a robery two weeks ago
and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
we have no suspects
now at that time handon new jersey was the most andgeror city in america
and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
they're like the baseball scoutps 20 years ago
it impacts everything
it worked for the open aids and it worked in the state of new jersey
they're just waiting for their day in courts
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
ands 207 years old
and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a photo profile for your facebook
what about you
i was growing through a hard time as well
i'd like you what
this is the only part that's battery backed up
woman's day coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results will often surprise
i don't care
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
they don't represent what our views are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
this economy won't work and thomas jeffersons saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
but do you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at copying their nationural environment to get them to thrive
what makes the heart unique
i want to be the center of attention
why are you they not working
this is what i'm fulling naturally be able to do
did you hear he has gone mad
thank you very much
why not just let vistices compete
and then i thought there's got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
yes it's hard
that's the status quo today
they can't get what they need when they need it
of just six people
the water stay there forever
he's quite the opposite
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
so why don't we leverage that
could we leverage the cloud
well that's the past
we need portable health benefits
how should we work
it's about earning as much as you possibly can
how should we live
we need to reinvent labor organizing
i would never want to do that
take a look at these
only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dre are free
sort of leadership by humiliation
he said where is he now
thanks for askin
and they are not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we are magic
but it's not enough
i'm built a career
thank you very much
do you speil money
we would' colored that
but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my beavy guns
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
that didn't go overall well
we can open up city hall
i love building robots
what about manipulations
so that's mobile manipulation
and he wanted one so badly
we can't identify with that part
that didn't happen to me
it made a go wet
make it go away
make it got
thank you very much
it's nowally teaching them how to ride a bike
but here's the things
i don't know
and that's bad
it was a pallem
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
my parent came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of my
so what was i going to do
that is the right answer
constant baker m leve
how old are you
are therese potential made
are they attractive
i didn't feel like i wasin the wrong body
when you're six maybe you can do that
so i changed my immediate goal to 10000 faces
what makes technology useful and usable
we have to turn that around
and that led me to this project
i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
i went to church as often as i could
how do they operate
why are we embedded in social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
so we have these feast and samon cycles
so what do you think happens to these e gals
once again women get the angroogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
and in fact it probably won't
we've done the research
they are often not recognized that pom
women are worth it
mortality is not going down it's going up
he had to impersonate a man
so thank you for your attention
it told us about hormone replacement therapy
and not enough is being done about this
i'm not sure what it was
and we like to think it's not going to take 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
you would be issuing orders from above
but in fact they found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
this is a real mystery
he was also the first pesson to call me a feminist
my brothers are not as interested as i am
she could come over and help me
how do you change your behavior
even that wasn't enough
some good not everybody
she wanted to change policy at the government level
we're going to eat these cows
it's not a luxury
it's not optional
they're nothing shipped up here
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been to pleasure speak to you
but it's not just china
where are the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just iraq and afghanistans
i do believe we can fix what's broken
we all want to
he got hard time i
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history and that's the one that we have
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was not only way to get anything done
efficiency is four robots
human relationships are not efficient
that's thevailable right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control over these forces
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had a duckin cover under her desk at schools
but it's also an important date for another reasons
but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
maybe i did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket science
pick up the keys
i actually have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and fuilling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military academy
that's the work that stands before us
it's an unconscious process
it's an automatic process
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
in fact it's more like ive percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
i don't have any anpou
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other for astlip of water
they were unexpected pleasures
or where' sh he left
how much can we change
so when we met chuck with a senior in high school
the question for us knowow isge how much can we make of it
not a single one
i will be back
it's the war on terror
but i love it for a totally different reason
they make sense of the path
but it wasn't just individuals
what a contradiction
but it's different
this is not a putot down of anyone
it is irresponsible
it is wrong
are we brave enough to welcome it
started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
they need support
we had law enforcement partners
so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
it cracked open my world
his name is lonne hods and he is a veteran of vietnam
she would hide in the closet
they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
they want to know how often this all gets outside
are you losing your mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem diy
so what happens next
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
why we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
he also had 11 children
not the wife not the kids
he should not have been surprised
please look at me
so no more messing diuys
that option is actually not on the table
so it's up to us
but i would go int on occasion
and this routine went on for some times
and now i love pangages
most of my friendsreaken japanese
i was always very small
i nothing
so water was something that scared me to beginning
so i thought why not punish myself
and this became my holy griil i was at a stem
i tried everything
and i thought this would be great fun
i'm a to zson
why was it made
it's a fucking adgy
they feel at home
how is it made
make it about the other party
why do we need to study this anymore
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate in our setbtled civilizations
imagine juggling a snowball across the troumpets
indeed we run the risk of making things worse
we are seeing the baby brain
there were others like myself who were full time
and he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not a dirty word
but those surveillance features come at a cost
government officials are extremely mad
i have to take a year off
i exist because i have my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
they grow crops
and so i think that nature is not that which is unntouched by humanity man or woman
and this is crazy
i just disagree with this
i want to go
every kid lives near nature
there's poonation going on
there's people everywhere
like he evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
and i was like oh the amazon
and i'm sure the figures are similar oth cindes
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
the rituals were familiar
how could i come from a nation
what kind of rituals are they
one billion people
but the magnitude the problem is something we need to appreciate
i know it worked
but i'm not happy
so i went to my daughter
is it that i write very well
you might geting peaed for that
so let's start then
i want to know how they impact me
i want to know how i impact themma
lots of money
this is great
it's the top predator
but i'm going to be so healthy
supporting local economies
i made more money
we've seen an image of our blue planet our a world banks
i love red wines
we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
why are you sure
so how do we do that
you say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in a day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
how else can we create new ideas
china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
but some of our grandchildren probably will
it's natural connective tissue
can we really scale this up
then they had to bring them in
but you know what the actual facts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't right
without it we literally can't interface with others
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
for any national leader
he wouldn't like the answer
they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
the supreme court has fallen way down from what it's used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have it
there will be invisible capacity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of first ten people to have this surgery
plus we have stem cells
and when i was pen i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child develop autism
that was powerful
raise your hands
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the haati earthquake
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carys self
and we couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing has grown as the city
you're in there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformation the climate transformations we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw it written down to meay
that's sort of the state of the art
and now we want to do a double double of the age way of coming through
and so they took them to some sake place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what had happened to my brain
we now have a platform
and my whole world did open up
and who does that fenisis
i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
we bought one of these
come on man
but there is actually more to the story than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how the molecules arere put together
effectively the saliban creates a complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so forarth they have no resources to get them back
if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimended
does any of this matter
i'm not a military rat
one was to be a soldier
they signed because they wanted some form of revenge
the other was be a baseball player
but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
prettyool
we have the plan
i am thinking of your love and me
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love vum
i am torn by  love for me
remember what i said my love
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
we might say then well let's not worry about this
i mean at some point it's going to be your problem to
how does it happen
it was like a star trekpisode
and that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
you can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
we can see everything on wikipedia
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is that possible
so going wrong's not like we don't have comedy in theiddleast
they have that idea
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get be at my job i'd just upgrade my browser
they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupts or by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need a surgery that accent
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i couldn't tear myself away from the covered
african americans supported at a higher level than had ever been recorded
and others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
we are looking for something more
i do like magic
will you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be the case
we can change our minds
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
i got about 3000 emails
my own website
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much potential
it's about proving who you are and what you can do
brought in younger men
and i went back home and i said deadyeah i don't know who i am
and this is true
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
you board the plane
the engine fails
the plane takes off
they dreamed of a variety of horrifying scenarios
there were no backdors
how do you get to build those relationships
you just had to do things sometimes
so we created a new spool
and boy they were like what
but that doesn't mean that we can't
that's a very good point
we were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this is what i heard from a lot of outlerages people
the answer was no
this is how stuff is made memorable
and i got pretty into it
you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
now i know why i am here
well guess what
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of traum am i talking about here
for hepatitis it was also 2 half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
ll imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a band
and that's pretty amazing
but eventually they did come around
you are healer in a stoneyge village
and so it's perfect for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
they're not donated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i' thought poetry was just self expression
there's no other way
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience as it relates cementering
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis that's getting worst day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product of service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
ok then we could make a mobile gaiger counter
you can get volunteers
you can drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of you
imagine if we had across the country right now in multle places but
i have passion in my heart
it's just a wall
those of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
well not yet
has a coherent movement
look at these pretty structures
their faces broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will pay dividends
and in many cases we don't
but we all should
dan replies so often you won't even notice it
that wasn't the case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no more charge before you use
and then something falls off the wall
i can hardly wait
only one of the people are actually farmers
talk to farmers
so what can we do
he cares if up balls news
they don't get their money out
taking my child
she worked in a bank
i believe a story there has to be told
i have to record it
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
he was smiling and we said go
we've been working together since sence our kids really
which brought us to this
you don't do much shouting
it wasn't who i was
here s where i stand
they don't have meaning
it's changed the way we talk

and he thinks i'm saying take my picture
things were going well
why are we skipping over this
this is a really important chaptter to me
i w understand this relationship
i went to the dean
you're doing incredibly important work
and so many of my early memories involveed intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders
one year i came up with a bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the worse
you made it work for me
we know why kids don't learn
there's no need to play the market
i look at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the global level
how could i let them down
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
it's always what it was and what it can be
let us have a hong kong nearby
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
i wasn't very good at reading things
we're on the grid
thank you very much

i don't paint
this was going to become really freak and obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad guys

we let other people worry about it
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
where would it go

' the whole internet
i was looking for this thing that only fool seemed to look for
you can walk around them
you are all collective
but what is an idea drawer
and if it's deptly okllo what's the jokees
here i'm one person talking to you
we just neinged to keep going
we don't even m mores lw to continue
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artifici intelligence
we have problems that we desperately need to solve
three billion people today with cell phones can't taxess internet
don't create solutions to impress customers
so what did they do
why is it important now
and not just that
they met together
he was talking about the importance of coaching boys int to men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
and let me just put this in context
and you know what else you did
and that's what we did
we met men where they were at and we built a program
why do i believe this
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of our thoughts
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still missing a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
this is your chance
which incidin onally is only a third correcty
i don't mean giving up the internet
it is my belief that to create these rare game changes requires you to fall off at least

and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
that's what we do
you were born to
of those seven have nuclear weapons
but it's a global phenomenon

we're going to stay with them forever
that interface is beautiful
and does it matter
i w was start a b the interaction design
designers aspired to be really great designers
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
you know it's like once again there is the full problem of design being often understood for art
but we want what we aspire to lave the cod
i don't understand it
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
go i sat again sweat forming on my brow
for africans homegrown science fiction can be a will to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writings
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
it is in the water
it was faulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it works
it's a marker of empathy
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language that use by real people have them
textings has developed on from this slash
that's what texting is
and so how does your brain give you that detail
i know i have
predictions are the basis of every experience that you had
if using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meanings
i'm tollly serious
not what is it
they are the basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
well that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we are going to go even deeper than the human body
when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob what
they also monitor the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we're going down to the cellular level these days
i've struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them

there is an animated series in the works
and she's looking as young as ever
they have divergent values
throu are noternal cameras
the economy needs them
i wanted to understand who takes the job
whoo cleans up after us
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project with them
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
and this leads to oudities
but this is the source of innovation
if we're still hungry we might have some more
we're not playing with each other
there's a e diit ways to eat piza
but if you want move we'll have no choice but to run you down
i went to extrem lengths to try to be straight
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
i see now i never was one and not the other
i will not be plained
one woman loses her head
face with absence
one woman feeds on trash
my spine curved spiral
one woman gives birth to borders
i will crackh my own drum
sickness health tender violence
i live cycles of light in darkness
one woman straps herself
where do refugee hearts go
plus the bombs left behind
one woman never did
we marn women complicated
one woman shoots her face
harvest contaminated to backles
rhythm is half silence
one woman gives birth to a baby
fy not ask all of the states to do that instead
my father worked at this factory he set
my grandfather worked at his factories
and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
that even small scale farmers can leverage
this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
it's about people
the met outcomes
china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
we just need to act on it
well i didn't have any idea
it would be a mall and not apart
i had to have faith
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
how is that possible
they want e treatment
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
we are all responsible
but that's kind of a big problem

i know i did it
so i was jealous
and i think i'm a normal person
and i was really scared
but i found one
the rony is so obvious right
that's next to impossible
so i went in that direction
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
what is weth dying for
i didn't know where i was
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to

we know that we are right theyay are wrong
we have to throw it away
how can we get so much information out of so little motion
we push and pool and poke and prog things
you would just get noise back

originally the sample was aged 18 to 94
we take less notice of trivial matters
how frustrated are you right now
we know that every cell has a sex
but linda was lucky
we have the tools but we laugh the collective will and momentum
but for too many women that's not the case
she found us we found her disease
the authors looked at papers written over a 1en year period and hundreds had to be thrown out

it's the group gels
but we're not done yet
and you don't leave them where they are
all of you are members of tribes
pretty much everybody else who goes hoes
there was no road map
but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
you don't want this

i don't know anybody
and he grew up essentially in stage one
it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
if you want this experience to live on as something historic then if of perceptions
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
look have that
we don't trust the man
i do understand it
no one' ever stood up before
it's a debate about words about metaphors
i don't know
you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases

what about whoulio
and do you know what
it brings people together and it supports creativity and social prohesion
they were right

i teach at stanford
i would listen to the heart
this was when i was in texas

it would stop
it would start
we can do it again
and it is this really the solution

but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world

so let's get started now
i was considered a radical
i was living in my own apartment
i was no longer homeless
i didn't know succeed
why are you really here
and i cried
i hadn't bathed in three days
i was winning awards

i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such braverains
some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break the girl
i am full of contradictions
i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
we have the right to res fact
i want no part of any of that
i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given women's feminism
it really is quite phenomenal
who or what inspires you and why
that's different from actually having an effective adention
5 percent today
how's that possible
that is great

when you really look at how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
what is it that he smisses
some woman got out of the army and had tremends psychological problems when they got home
how does that work
that's what so complicated about war
it's not what i had expected
it was incredibly hot
the boys are out there for eight year
we have to answer that
they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically
and they don't need to ask permission
that's my question
what this guy talking about
let me illustrate this
this is completely desin
that's a terrible waste of time
that only if you are paid by the hour
now do something different that
that would not work
you're more cautious
it is the default option
and you walk around and it points to things
you just move away
now hamilton was everything madison was not
first they founded political parties
and they did it in the good old fashioned way
they change from persons to person

let's help them have a fls
and that's what we did
we hear terrorism
the silent majority does not need to be silent

they were all fighte
and worked like a dold
and that's all
i man never go to your house you may never come to my house

the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
this is possible
even when it's so hard
that's what happened with my dad
they get scared to move
they get scared to walk around
my dad has alzheimer's disease
you' trying to become a beter person
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
they won the game
and the problem that we're solving is what are those things
so bear with me
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i know platforms i know computers they've put me on the internet when i was young i
a digital world farm
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
why didn't you just tell me that
what can i learn with you
did you find the gold
so that was easy
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
we weren't considered the real thing
so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are showing out

that's awful right
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
it's just incredible
i was terrified
the same tool that united us to toouple dictators

growing up i was always intrigued by how people change
again much just faze
i don't love thisena

we must adoppt that way of giving back
i'm not shure
i was right here withia
he's five years old
and i thought what am i thinking
it's not one wake
and that's what i'm calling for here now
so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest you
so what do we do
we almoston feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
do the same thing it's worths
and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that we' are takingen before something
we said yes
we were so excited
the greeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite

we have to fix our education
he's had a technology conference in florida
nor what do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably won't
we have to fix the internet
most independent media was shut down
now don't get me wrong
of course they wouldn't
i could make that decision
that's not an impropable sample
you know about numbers
you can navigate space
you saw him act
it made me feel smart
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
he was the coldest i've ever been
