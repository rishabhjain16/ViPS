they want to be part of it
and they said i wouldn' work in glob poverty but what would it mean about my career
i don't know
i a doction
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anythings
so i looked for furniture
well why is that
what differences it make if they talk like jari ke fail
well what differencees this made them
ow i will maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is thood
the boys reminded me of home
it wasn't like them to misspractice
one percent to get to do that
i don't want to
i said in arabic
after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
theyould hit the jackpot
len the endless to the animal
i'm in the crucipble right now
what is the abstraction
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an opera all night long
that's what moves you
i know you understand that
i have an idea of receiving the wall
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of the anti reality tv
and it s hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so natally i ask what is african
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
it should be inspiring
how youook for sure
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply critical to our eonomy
and i remember we had experienced with this
in other words a corner could find these things becausesist it' a fatal recipe
what can we do in all of us
roughly 300 sa7ings and loans involved roughly 600 senior visions
what do we need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
patriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
and guess what silicon valley
i've tried engag in people
and they also knew that they could t happen to a workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people started contributing ideas
and that's actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super freal and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
how togin it with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
w you train them however to adjust caussting accordings of weere they are
he wanted to stit where he could stannd the room orere he could to plan a sape prouse we he could get his hands
and that's exactly what that is
you remember callos
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always ty to make it faster
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to the tiptions
there's no more other
so we did the analysis a in a slightly different way
we paid 2 to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equation
sustainability has got to be a precompetitivisu
even if we get everybodys working on we've got to be srpegous
so was mother treat
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have an overview
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it' is given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
again in a car
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
i was petrified
not a lot of cannds
and when she went to some plane to a major he said what
sexual horizment sell and discriminate
they just do it
they all look the same under mics means to a first approximation
well i think about this all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
and de has progressed
it is happening every day
they are looking looking and finding love
how we are you
i think this is a problem
but there's rills in boston
it makes more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like why did i really have to mootor lonw
it's not that they didn't want me think critically
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
and you've broken your back
the ky re knowledge
these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gass
we need to be part of a community to survive
is it about e quality
we all know deep inside what the answer is
we've n not since we were babies
i started looking at them really carefully
it's about sixems
i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lock ourselves in the room for two days and we try to figure out what bound us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its core values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brains to tune out with somebody else's issues
this meant that the movements demanding changed knew what they were against crushing poverty widing
well very often we think about political change in defined apartments these days
so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we had accomplished
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just part of the same species
we part of the same family
i have three thoughts so i see how they fight
and i won't name names because you know who you are
we neated a disruption of real life and important work
we've all done with
in 10 degrees below zero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive j doses of chemotherapy
and she suffered so much
there's love and their friendship and theirse protection
could we merge
the question why did she say
which is why that iv leg degree and the wall streeet job and his bright shining future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap theguiseis love one
he kept one in the gloved compartment of our car
and here's where those guns comeen
i had just graduated from harvard college
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your cow workers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
and when we were unprepared we overreiaet
theyidre not my children
and i did not know what to sayid
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locakes
on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should youe
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11 o'clock they stoped talking about these delily issues
you can try it
everything in youverweres out
and that puredw my mind
how cool is that
that's nothing special
it had no choice
it had no choice
i realized of course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get tasks to mess it up
one of them got craalled up in the water
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach summal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just stay home
so we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that god knows me
who wote that
i tagged along with my neighbors
meet you ath
and i said to myself i want to get me one of them
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
bully it matters a lot
he it what you mean
he's a great guy
so i'm not saying that saying the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your jobing seem challenging
the science is then
data drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from logic company that i work for
but we're not there ygetin
you see there's a lot of things which just don't have data all
with that you can actually trigger aid funding before crisis can happen
it's a win all around
it's a comment ofv age for bringing data into the humanitarian worlds
and that's the big deal for a profession that's in hide amain
and germany friends
surely we know enough
four times the mass of the sun
we have to get quiet
you haven't orned it
how can we do it
there's a flip side as well
is shocking to realize that only 28 of american
i will not forget the day we got that text message
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not to telly one
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one's an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text cotline
who's that the event
i cm you it in my company
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
here reconcilable differences right
they supported me all the way through it
if that's something we had to celebrate
is it gotten better
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something was wrong
to nazis invaded the netherlands
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
we'd love your help
blocks have names
we have no suspats
we took cm in off the top of the list as the most interestity in america
i ran the cammton police department because of that
and all of thisse matters are grezly because we're probably safy to me is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data was by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make their most critical decision
and at the upp other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
it impacts sentency
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low levels to our cases on the streets just arouf the corner from our office and treusting
it impacts crime and violence
some people call it data science
and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago
and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write some dna and they would put it up on the board
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i felt the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the aral foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have no suspects
now at that time came to new jergy was the most interest city in america
and when i talk to judges around in the united states which i do all the time now they all see the same
their lik to be spilted outn 20 years ago
it impacts everything
it worked for the oaken hande and it worked in the state of neutersey
they're just waiting for their day and course
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
i'm 2ed se7 years old
and re connected over really small states like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a fosso profile for your facebook
what about youth
i was going through a hotd time as well
i' watch
it's the only part that's battery backed up
wom's dare is coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results weill often surprise
i don't ca
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be caed unproductive
they don't represent what our views are
we had the battle between jefferson and camelson
this economy won't work and thomas jefferson's saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
do you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environments to get them to thrive
what makes the hard read
i want to be the center of attention
why is it not working
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
did you care here has gone mark
thank you very much
why not just let businesses compete
and then i thought this got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
l's it's hard
that's the thatusrooe today
they need get what they need when they need it
of just six people
do's the water stay there forever
quire the opposite
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype was set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have to
so why don't we leverage that
could we leverage the cloud
and that's the batch
we need portable health benefits
how should we work
it's about earning as much as you possibly can
how should be there
we need to reinvent laborganizing
i would never want to do that
take a look at for these
all we don't know that it's a homeess shelter
you don't have to bring iny waters because the washhert drwiner are free
sort of leadership by humiliation
and i said where is he now
thanks for asking
and they're not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we are imagice
but it's not enough
i've built a career
thank you very much
you spell money
we would tolerate that
but when i was little i would remember he would kill flies in our house with my b gun
so to sumiise if we could offer a cop quality education to everyone around the world for free
that didn't gover really well
we can open up siting hall
i love building robots
what about manipulation
so that's mobile manipulation
i didn' want it want to so badly
we can't identify with that part
that doidn't happen to me
make it gooway
ke could go away
medical wing
thank you very much
it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
but here's the thing
i don't know
and that's bad
he was apology
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
my parents came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
so what was i going to do
that is the right answer
constinse bager malley
how old are you
i the potential mate
are thin the extractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
when you're six babers to do that
so i changed my immediate goal to 10000 faces
what makes technology useful and usable
we have to turn that around
and that leds me to this project
i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
so when the church is often is not clear
how do they operate
why are we embedded in social networks
and the daughter was exhausted comparing for her mother
how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
so we have thesefex and famine cycles
so what do you think happens to theseig gals
we went again women getting angi gram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
and in fact it probably wants
we've done the research
they're often not recognized at home
women are worth it
mortality is not going down just's going up
she had to impersonate a man
so thank you for your attention
they told us about home on replacement therapy
and not enough it' being done about this
i'm not sure what it was
and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
you would be suing orders from a above
but in fact it found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
this is a real mst cy
it was also the first preon to callon a feminist
my brother's a lot' interested that i am
he could come over and help me
how do you change your behavior
even that wasn' enough
some did not everybody
she wanted to change policy at the government level
with the heath' cass
it's not an l tr
it's not option
there' not being shipped up peter
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
but it's not just china
we are the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own works
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just i rock in afghanistan
i do believe we can fix what's broken
we all want to
he got part time
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history and it's the one that we have
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of this geological record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagined that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was only way to get anything done
efficiency is for robotics
human relationships are not efficient
that's available right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control of these forces
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she ever had to stuck and cover under her desk at school
but it's also an important day for another reason
but before that cooperation could be realized enedy was assassinated and that part of the
maybe i didn' experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rock' science
pick up the keys
i a usually have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and pulling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military academy
that's the work that stands before us
it's an unconscious process
it's an automatic process
we go out there and we copy our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
in fact it iss more like five percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
i don't have anysa
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other for a tip of water
they were unexpected pleasures
or whar t love
how much can we change
so when we met chalcking the senior in high school
the question for us now is how much can do we make of it
not a single one
i will be back
it's the war on towr
but i love it for us totally give all theseam
they make sense of the past
but it wasn't just individuals
what a contradiction
but it's different
it's not have put down of anyone
irresponsible
it is wrong
are we brave enough to welcome it
started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
they need topport
we had law forceent progress
so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
it cracked open my world
his name is lanyhage until he's a veteran of vietnam
she would hide in the closet
they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
they want to know how often dog gets outside
are you losing your mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem diy
so what happens next
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
he also had 11 children
not thewise not the kids
it should not have been surprised
please look at me
so no more masicis
caption is actually not on the table
so it's up to us
but i would go in on occasion
and this routine went on for some time
and now i love compers
most of friend were tak in japanese
it was always very small
and of nothing
so water was something that scared me to begin with
so i thought why not punch myself
and this became my holy grand my rosetta stone
i tried everything
i thought this would be great fun
i'm in tuoson
why was it madze
it's a fucking orgine
they feel at home
how is it made
make it about the other partny
why d doon't weed to study this any more
what if the exact relationship between level of greenhouse gases and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate in our sett of civilizations
imagine juggling a snowball across the toompic
indeed we won the risk of making things worse
we're seeing the baby's brain
there were others like myself who were full time
and he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not a dirty word
but those surveillance features come at a cost
government officials are extremely mad
i have to take a year off
i exist because i have my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
they grow crops
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity maneral woman
and this is crazy
i just didagree with this
i want to go
every kid lives hen nation
there's polyation going on
there's people everywhere
like we involved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
and i was like old the amazon
and i'm sure the figures are similar other hundred
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
the rituals were famillions
how could i come from the nation
what kind of vituals are these
one billion people
but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
i know it works
but i'm not happy
so i want to myacter
is it that i live anyy
you might get im peace for that
let's start there
i want to know how they impact me
i want to know how i impact them
lots the money
thish is great
it's the top creditor
i'm not bit so helpy
u sporting local economies
i made more money
we've seen an image of our blue plant our world bank
i love way one
we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
yet what she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
what are you chir
so how do we do that
you say you're working more than 3 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in the day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working a way more than full time cows
how else do we create new ideas
china is the world's greatest standic poverty program over the last three decades
but some of our grandchildren probably will
it's natural connected tissue
can we really scale this up
then they had to bring them in
but you know what theal facts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't right
without it we niterally can't interface with others
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
for any national leaders
he wouldn't like the answer
they were arguing with one another about access to the hoing site
the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have us
there will be invisible capacity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first ten people to have this surgery
because we have stem cells
and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child develop autism
that was the powerful
raise your hand
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the heati earthquake
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry ong bag from the ground to the cary seth
and we couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing has thrownisity
you're in there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he sawed written down to me
that's sort of the state of the iona
and now we want to do a double double of the age way of coming through
and so they took them to some safe place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what' had happened to my brain
we now have a platform
and my whown world did open up
and youid that penethry
i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
well we bought one of these
gome on men
but there's actually more to the story than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how the molecules arere put together
effectively the taribol tyate a complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
if any child is found violating these torules he is severely reprimanded
does any of us fatter
i'm not a military at
one was to be a soldier
theyciged because they wanted some form of avenge
the other w to be a baseball player
but if they don't stay in paiss the international pressure will be overwhelming
prety cool
we have the plan
i am thinking of your lfe for me
paying runs through my body with the fires of my love vew
i am torn by your love for me
remember what i said my love
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
we might say then well let's not worry about this
that means at some point it's going to be your problem too
how does it happen
it was like a star likeck a personal
that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of monopolies
we can see everything on wikipedia
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is as possible
going wrong it's not that we don't how my milice
they have bad ideas
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better my job i just need to upgrade my brother
they know you can fail by starting a business to go to bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winner has come from a different cribal group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need to starch to relect
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i couldn't care myself away from the coverage
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
and others resented this comparison between gay rights civil rights and
we' are looking for something more
i do like magic
but you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be the case
we can't change our minds
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
i got about 3000 l mils
my own website
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have woralked over me
but there is so much potential
it's about proving who you are and what you can do
brought and younger men
and i went back home and i said dadd and i don't know who i am
and this is true
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
you board the plane
the engine fails
the plane takes off
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
there were no badck doors
how do you get to build those relationships
you've just had a new thing sometimes
so we created a new cour
and bore they were like what
but that doesn't mean that we can't
now that's a very very good point
we were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this is what i heard from a lot of out raich people
the answer was no
this is h howse stuff that is made memorable
and i got puttty into it
do you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous foris sculpture
now i know why i'm here
well get whine
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of tom am i talking about here
for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bit
and that's prettymazing
but eventually they didn't come around
you are here in a stonage village
and so it's perfect for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
they're not donated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
there is no other way
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new productor's service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
okn we could make a mobile tigger countern
we can get volunteers
when you drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of them
imagine if we had across the country right now in local places but
i have passion in my heart
it's just a wall
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
well not yet
has the coherent movement
look at this pretty structure
their faces broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
why is that hurd
that will change everything when you see that
this will pay dividends
and in many cases we don't
but we all could
danapplies so often you won't even notice it
that wasn't the case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no more charged before youe
and then something falls off the walk
i can hark the one
only one percent of the pporrection farmers
sok to famers
so what can we do
who cares about bosni
they don't get their money out
i take my child
she works in a bank
i believe it's a story there has to be told
i have to report it
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
he was smiling and we said go
we've been working together wisting to our kids really
wasich brought us to this
you don't do much sharing
it wasn't who i was
here's where i stand
they don't have meaning
changed the way we tak
had new idea
the bord ofvent
why don't they trust the lock
they don't trust the law
it's not true
we don't consolt you we don't use videio
so what to do in actu
but i need your help
what is that
to contacted anyone and everyone who was villing to buy my weth
give me input
there's nothing underground about it
it's right there for you to find
we only sell you airtime
which means take my camera
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
and he thinks i'm saying to take my picture
things were going well
why are we skipping over this
this is the really important chaption to me
i want tostand the relationships
i went to the dese
you're doing an incredibly important work
and so many of my earnly memories involved intricate stayge dreams wh i was walked across borders
one year i came up with a bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the words
you made it work for me
we know why kids don't learn
there's no need to play the market
i looked at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the global level
how could i let them down
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
it's always what it was and what it can be
let us have a hong kong nearbyke
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
i wasn't very good at weading things
we're on the grid
thanks very much
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarce to are helpful
there won't be a single moment in the schedule
i don't paint
this is going to become really freaking and obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad guys
again it will not happen overnight
i mean everyone did
it needs to happen
is it heavy
let other people worry about it
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
where would it go
you can experience their sense of place
who would i meet
should i go there
it's the whole internet
i was looking for this thing that only food seemed to look for
you can walk around them
you're all collective
so what is an idea drying
and if it's completely ok what's the joke
here i'm one person talking to you
we just need to keep going
we don't need more to law to continue
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial casge
i we have problems that we desperately need to solve
three billion people today with cell phmes cant ateternct
don't create solutions to impress custimution
so what did they do
why is it important now
and not just that
they were together
and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys and men and changing the culature of the locker room and giving
and let me just put this in context
and you know what else we did
and that's what we did
we met men where they were at and we built a program
why do i believe this
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of our spots
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still missing a critical ailment
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
this is your chance
which internal is only a third correct
i don't mean giving up the internet
it is my belief that to create these rare game changes requires you to pull off at these
one you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
do you get several things
and so they added oxygen to methane gas
the gas that they use at first and medications with oxygens
and to do so we've had to believe and impossible things
that's what we do
you were born too
of those seven have nocalar weapons
but it's a global phenomenon
just think about it
it's very hard to get of course
we're going to stay with them forever
that interface is beautiful
and does it matter
i was startking a bit interaction to diay
designers aspire to be really great designers
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
it's like once again that's the whole problem of design being oftimis understooit for art
what we want what we aspire to is the codes
i don't understand that
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserve so much more
go i sat again sweat forming on my brown
for african home grown science fiction can be a will to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
it is in the water
it was faulty in most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
it's a marker of empasis
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language that is used by real people has them
testing has developed one from this slash
that's what texting is
and so how does your brain give you that detail
i know i have
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
it's used to past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
i'm soally serious
not what he did
they are the basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like commness and
we that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
when in the history of humanity has ever been possible for one person to rab
they also monitor the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we're going down to the cellular level of these days
i struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
what if i had told them my story years ago
after all it wasn't bit unconventional
they have different interests
but it's not about fire and bringstone either
it means for youth and it's a new arab tv chanil
there's an animated series in the work
and she's looking as young as ever
they have diversion values
through our nritional cameras
the economy iss them
i wanted to understand who takes the job
who cleans up after us
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project with them
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
and this leads to oddies
but this is the source of innovation
if we're still hungry we might have some more
we're not playing with each other
they're a million diive ways to eat pizz
but if you want moves we'll have no choice but'll run you gow
i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
i see now i never was one and not the other
i will not be plagued
one woman led her head
face with absence
one woman feeds on trash
my spine curved biver
one woman gives birth two borders
i would craft my own drum
tick it health tender violence
i live cycles of light and darkness
one woman scrapped herself

it's about people
the net outcome
china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
we just need to act on it
well i didn't have any idea
it would be a mall and not a par
i had to have faiths
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
how is that possible
they want their treatment
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnency otherwise something might so wrong
we are all responsible
but that's kind of a big problem
so after 25 years i did want to feel as though i was running dry
they were sitt in them forever

what are the researchers learning
i knowo i did it
so i was jealous
and they came a normal person
and i was really scared
but i found one
the irony so obvious right
that's next to impossible
so i went in that to action
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
what is were dying for
i didn't know where i was
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
and this idea is actually nothing news
one way around this is to draw pictures

if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
well that's what i thought
hartest your internal strength
we know that we are right there are wrong
we have to throw it away
how can we get so much information out of so little motion
we push and pool and pok and brath things
we would just get noise back

originally example was agge 18 to 94
we take less notice of civian matters

we know that every single has a tex
but lada was lucky
we have the tools but we lack the collective will and moment
but for too many women that's not the case
she found us we found her disease
the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out

as an inventor i try and turn fantasy into reality
not when you get lung cancers
no planton missing no fish

he comes out of a place called the gallup organization
you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people asescribe about how
if you want this experience to live on as something as storeing then as the reception
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
let's come down
we don't trust demand
i do understand it
ons ever said that before
this is debate about words about metaphors
i don't know
you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
doesn't happen very much
it has to stop
what about polio
and you know what
it brings people together and supports creativity and social cohes
they were right
they had her scand inside out
we're losing a ritual
i teach at stanford
and would listen to the hearts
this was when i was in texas
i'm physician practicing with cutting edge technology

so i learned never to move
it would gip a beat

it would start
we can do it again
and this is this really the solution
when you go up por you want to be rich
getting a college education is a 20 year investment
ow in all serious nesss movies are actually really important
storiestelling is so important

what if obesity isn't the cause of insulant resistance at all
goad unlucky
but you know what
but you know what
how far away it was defent trining
i am fascinated by those times when people do not see hye to eye
so this is not this slogan from an inspirational poster
otherwise millions more will die
i even read m int tell of helpooks
i would love to hear from you
the first lesson is about hum relief
try it and let me know how it works for you
how no
i am certainly not the hard as working
i was the first non family investor in namedonnd
it has never happened
i was a mediocreal students
this is not sense
this is just one face of a booming sextrade crossed the arab region
but i grew up beganada far from my arab roots
social change doesn't happen in the arab reation through traumatic confrontation
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arabaturists
about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
myy other great passion is the environment
so let's get started now
i was considered a radical
i was living in my own apartment
i w was no longer harmless
i didn't know i suced
why are you really here
and i fried
i hadn't baed in three days
i was winning award
would you like to create a second one to get
it's been thought about for a while
well i was surprised
i did not know this
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such brave very
some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break the girl
i am full of contradictions
i'm a fabinist but i'm a rather bad one
i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
they are gorgeous and head strong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
we have the right to respect
i want no part of any of that
i learned to writeit them and then i learned to write as myself
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dsecting any given women' feminism
it really is quite phenomenal
you or what inspires you and why
that's different from actually having an effective accpy
5 the day
how did that process
that is great
thank you very much
how much they us
what do they have
they have a common cold
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
do they have age
you make it flow hunnder and over
i'm a fifth generation texon
what do you doing
i guess i'm doing it right now
your wife leufft there
i suid a shame
why did you bring this up
she cid yana
and here's what you need to know
at what point did i think that was a good idea
have you lost your mind
i made a mistake
it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane
he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
we shouldn't be nationalistic
wh there is a self fulfilling prophecy
you learn more about how comput this work
but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read the writ
and whates it keep sore
w you really look at how is of that young people spend most of their time you can do technologies
what is it that he messes me
some of them got out of the army and had tremendous pychological problems when they got homees
how does that work
that's what's so complicated about war
it's not what i had expected
it was incredibly high
the boys are up there for a year
we have to answer that
they're too busy putting out daily fires to think that had suategioually
and they don't need to ask for permission
that's my question
whats this like talking about
let me illustrate this
it is completely dzn
that's a terrible waste of time
that only if youre paid by the hours
now there is something differentow
that would not work
you're more conscious
it is the default option
and you walk around and it points the things
you just move away
now hemilton was everything madison was not
first leve down this political parties
and they did it in the good old fasctor way
they changeed from person supporting
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment
she was doing ok
that was her finght
she learned about a rice
75 of them are women and children
she does and support networks
now we all specialities combining the digital technologies matching
it's almost becoming the syntax of a dual language
it turns out the evidence tells other onise
it's a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
young people as well
let's help them have a voice
and that's what we did
we can tell you with the
the silent mjority does not need to be silent
we can the canennos of war
thank you very much
so they felt safe to come there
i said we workedgether
that's your grandfather
we didn't understand the program
d' be a bad thing
they were all white
and work like a doll
and that's home
i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments and nonprofits have delivery armiess that are fully capable of covering in this wor
this is possible
even w it so hard
that's what happened with my dad
they get scared to move
they get scared to walk around
my dad is alzheimer's disease
i'm trying to become a better person
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
they want the game
and the problem we're solving is what are those things
so bear with me
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young at
a digital world farm
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
why didn't you just tell me that
what can i learn with you
did you find the goal
so that was easy
and the way to do is through the bloodstcream
we were considered the real thing
so we need the solutions and theedse people playing the game they are trying out
so that's it for now
that's an awful right
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
it's just incredible
i was sertrified
the same tool that united us to trople dictators
that's not to say it's impossible
growing up i was always intrigued by how people changed
again let's explain
i don't look it for up
that doesn't probably happen every day
now i'm ready from my interview
i needed an education
can i get my upgrade
we must adoppt that way of giving back
i'm not swortd
i would wrght there with there
is five years old
and i thought one of my fkings
it's not one way
and that's what i'm calling for here now
so you want to go to that board meeter but you only want to pay attention to the bestged interests
so what do we do
we almost don't feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
do the same thing at work
and so one of the major challenges of our projects really is to find photographs that we're taking before something
we said yes
we were so excited
agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
the sam i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
the answer to that question is a very definitive
what are you going to tan swarre others
it's all about what he used you for me
whereas even in taking a more of your innerotives your values
and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them more of our crappy products
and we think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
let's think about your ethical footprint
but quite frankly on that issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
he'ses technology conference from florida
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably woth
we have to fix the internet
most independent media would shut down
now don't get me wrong
of course they wnt
i could make that decision
that's not an improbable tip
you know about number
you can navigate the space
you saw him at tim
it maye me feel smart
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
i don't even know it's a real jobitle to be honest
it was the coldest i've ever been
