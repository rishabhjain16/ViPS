they want to be part of it
and they' i wouldn't wor them about it but what would it mean about my career
i don't know
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do any fan
so i looked for finnitcial
well why is that
what difference is they mke if they talk like j yourure'sign fout
we i want differencities maan
ow i will make that
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life this third
the boys you mi get me of home
it wasn't like them to miss practice
one percent you get to do that
i don't want to
it's not an arabic
after college that's what i needed to find a place to go home
they can get the jackpot
look at the endl and the animal
i mean the cruciill be right now
what is the abstractions
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an opera all night long
that's what moves you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for daving the wall
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of the anti reality tv
and it's hard and it takes curras but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
soont natally i ask them what he is defing
and it doesn't
it too six days to e deploy a global malword campaign
it could be inspiring
how do you look for sure
we created a diagnet succ
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply critical to our eomy
and i remember we had experienced with this
in other words a corderould find these things because this it's a fatal recipe
what can we do in our liation
roughly 300 s7s and thoses involved roughly 600 cenior visions
what do we need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stank for myself
patriarch is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survival of all forms of sexual abuse including three
and guess what silkon valley
i've tried engaging people
and they also knew that they could happen to the workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people started cootributing ideas
and that's actually what happens
this is it information
it's super fal and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
how to deal with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what lets me feel like
w you train them however you adjust acord to wear they are
he wanted to sit where he could stand the room or he could plan a sate prouse we could get his hands
and that's exactly what that is
you remember callos
you need to be ab to something with it
we'ill always tone many fracture
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to thecriptions
there's no more of it
so we did the analysis to in slightly different way
we payid 2 to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equation
sustainability has got to be a precompetitive
even if we get everybody working on we've got to be supeient
so whatid mother treat
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compasction
i don't have a owe of you
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust into response
because it is given by other people
we can do it two peoplegether trying to improve justice
you know what the time wantn to to that position
again in car
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and adding and shame
i was spectrified
not a lot of gasys
and when she went complained to a major he said what
d you gas me sentid to criminate
they toould do it
they all look the same bere i mean to a first approximation
well i think about this all the time
but now checkot where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
ind de has proggress
it happening every day
they are looking and looking and finding love
what are you
i need it is a problem
but the dre in balching
it makes more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like wh did i really have to moot learn
it's not that they didn't want me to crick
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
is it letting stu happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mailes to been thrown away
you've broken the back
that he really knowledge
these guys could be true to the pupo which was fally til and guys
we need to be part of a community to survive
is' about equality
we all lo dep inside with the answerers
we've not seen we were babies
i started looking at them really carefully
it's about sixstems
i looked at my friend who dri defens dry well writing off more than a billion dolles for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lock ourselves in the room for two days and we try to figure out we bound us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what it core values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brain to dooe out with somebody else's issue
this mant that the movements demand changed knew what they were against crushing poverty why
well very often we think about political change in defined apartments in day
so i want to talk to you today but when i think is a much more complete recipe for deeper
a couple of years ago a group of in canada decided that we were getting the limits of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm doing
we're not to part of the same piecies
we part of the same family
i have th resonghts so i se know how they fight
and i won't name names because i knowly what
was that is a disruption of real life and important work
we've all done it
brin ten0 degrees below zero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive joses of chemotherapy
she suffered so much
tous love and their friendship and their protection
we merch
the question why did she sayid
which is why that iv ne degree in the wal street job and it's brighthin of future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love psychological trap to guys' love one
he kept one in the gloved department of our car
and here's where those consum me
i had ex graduated from hard ciollege
no abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coorkers your friend and
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
and we were unprepared we overget
theyidre not my children
and i did not know what to sayke
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locare
on the other hand statistics that's the subject that you could and should you
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11 oclotic stopp talking about these ten issues
you can try it
everything use for the worere is that
and i pould to my mind
how cool is that
that's nothing special
he had no choice
it had no choice
i realized course that all countries are doed
just when that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get tanked to mess it up
one of them got called up in the water
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors she found a lump and stomach smal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
i thought we should just stay home
so we decided to go to the mose
i feel that god knows me
who wrote that
tacked along with my neighbors
i'll meet youo fair
and i said to myself i wouldn't get me one of them
i feel gririlty sometimes
you want to work for him
it mattter the lot
iaid what do you mean
he's a great guy you
so i'm not saying that taying the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your job isem challenging
the science is then
data drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated pack at tracking technology from the logic company that i work for
but we're not there again
you see there's a lot of things which don't have data on
with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
re's a wind all around
it's a comy of date for bringing data into the humanitarian worlds
and that's the big deal for a profession that denied made
and germany and friends
surely we know enough
four times a massive the son
we have to get quiet
you haveen't ord it
how can we do it
there's a flip side as well
is shocking to realize that only 28 of american
and will not forget the day we got that text message
texing has a 100 open rate
he told me not  toarly one
i think it might be a lifeline
that last oneed an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
who's that the event
i cm do it in my company
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
ill reconcitable differences right
they supported me all the way through it
that's something we had to celebrate
it's got better
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something was wrong
the nazis invaded the netherlands
when i get out of it am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't want anymore
we'd love to help h
blood have names
we have no such matterers
we shok came in off the top of the lens as the most interested in america
i ran the came to police department because of that
and all of these matters are crazy because we're probably safy something is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data was by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on you tocat and analytics to help make their most critical decision
and at the op other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
it in back saiden ty
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low levels dru cases on the streets just arouf the corner from our office interested
it about crime and violence
some people call it datatite
and one of them said we had a grabbary two weeks ago
and they would take a yellow stick they would write somethingi and they would put it up on the moard
they haven't yet been convicted of the crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to adminisure they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i felt the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the horal foundation i came backue looking at a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have nouspects
now at l that time came to newersey was the most interested in america
and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all see the same
their let the bigce purs dn 20 years ago
he impacts everything
it worked for the oken hand and it worked in the state of neuturesam
they're just waiting for their daily course
i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
i'm de finced 1 year old
and reconnected over really small things like the fact that i love ctra muting which is meally
this is not a fosso profile for your facebook
whaty about toe
i was going three a hot time as well
howon watch
this the only pl this batter backed up
women they' are teaming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results we off thee surprise
i don't know
wealth is ripped away from people who should be caught unproductive
they don't represent what cter view are it
we had the battle between jeffesicon and camusin
hy won't work and thomas jefferson's saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that isystem has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
as you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environments get them to d crive
what makes the hard reas
i want to be the centy of attention
why is it not working
this is what i'm supposed to ncturually be able to do
did you ca yet onn mind
thank you very much
why not just let businesses complete
and then i thought this got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
l' it's hard
that's the sid of say
they ne is that what they need when they need it
go just six people
this is what you sa there forever
quite the opusess
and then that's one
and after that initial prototype we set outed to make free and open source software so that others do not have
so why don't we lef for chating
could we leverage the cloud
and that's the b
we need portable health benefit
how should we work
it's about earning as much as you possibly can
how could be there
weed to reinvently porganize it
i would never want to do that
take a look for this
all we don't know that' the home reselt
you don't have to bre in it waters because the washt ding are free
so whatid i leadership by humiliation
he said where is he now
thanks for asking
and they're not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we imagine
but it's not enough
i've built a career
thank you very much
you to spnd money
we will tolerate that
but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with myght be a gun
so to some rise if we could offer a hob quality education to everyone around the world for free
that didn't go over really well
we can open up sitting hall
i love building robots
what about manipulation
so that's mobile population
i didn't want to want to so badly
we can't identify with that party
that didn't happen to me
make it go a way
make it away
make it go w
thank you very much
it's all i teach you them how to ride a bike
but here is the thing
i don't know
that bad
he was the poent
we can start putting an entire layer of digetital information on the real world
my parents came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of contention and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
so what was that going to do
that is the right us
constin baker malley
how oldver
i the position made
are the attractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
when you're si6 people to do that
so i changed my immediate hold 1 th000 faces
what makes technology useful un ususable
we have to turn that aroust
and that what means to this project
i became psychology researcher and i have to voted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
so when the church is often is not car
how do they operate
why are we embedded in social networks
and the daughter was exhaustive comparent for her mother
how far do they reach
mean how do they form
so we have defenatce and family cycles
so what do you think happens to the to gat
we went togain when we get an nangorap and nobody can tell that they have a problem
and in fact it probably wons
we've done the research
they're often not recognised that home
women are worth it
m tell it's not going down it's going up
she had to impersonate a mat
so thank you for your attention
and they told us about home when we play to p therapy
and not enough it's being done about this
i'm not sure what it was
and we'd like to think it's not in to thin 35 years
and the reat things that you' tayke anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building the goods and products and now we have the surface
you would be twing orders from the bove
but in fact it found something very surprising
but that really true anymore
this is the real mess cream
he was alo the first ps to called me a feminist
my brother's not' interested in i am
hes some alldter and helps me
how do you change your behavior
even that wasn' enough
sumsid not everybody
she need to change policy at the government level
with the heaty size
it's not inly tre
it's not an option
it not being chipped up here
and what was the result of that
and that's why i' spent a pleasure speaking to you
but it's not just china
we are the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own world
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just a wrockg k and ofutankan
i do believe we can fix what's broken you
we all want to
he got part time ice
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history that's the one that we have
how do you find a diny sool
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the imagin of a geollectrical record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was only whent get anything done
efficiency is for roboticce
human relationships are not afficiion
that's available right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control of these forces
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she ever had to stuck and cover annder her taic school
but it's also an important cay for another reason
but before that cooperation human realized enony was assassinated and that part of the
be this experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket science
to pick up the keys
i should have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and pulling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military cademy
that's the work that stands before us
it's an unhonsous process
it's an authomatic process
we go up there and we copy our cars and we drive from place to place
i have re sources
in fact it's more like five percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
i' have an it
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other for timp of water
they were unexpected pleasures
or wheret he lavegh
how much can we change
so when we metch our with to stinger in high school
the question for us now is how much kid do we make of
that lle one
i will be back
it's the war on c on
but i love it for us dontally giveve it
they make sense of the past
but it wasn't just individuals
what a contradtion
but it's different
it just not have put down of anyone
it is irresponsible
it isn't wrong
i would brave enough to welome it
started to walk in the community and takeifiing scientist to realize that they w not
they need the port
we had lag f supportan
so they won't go for a while they won't han out with their friends they won't need
it cracks open my world
his name is lanya he is the veteran of viet aam
she was id and closets
they want to know how much exercise your dog issaed
they want to know how often dog gets out dide
are you losing your mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem di

why aren't we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
whose sour to inherit his name and his swtcht
he also had 11 children
nottherwise not the kids
it should not have been surprised
please you can me
so no more mexic iy
s a to now on the table
so was up to used
but it was going on occasion
and this route went on for some time
and now i love nb
most of my friends wouldaking japanese
it was always very small
and you not there
so water was something thatsg me at the beginn with
i thought why not beunch myself
and this became my whole degree on my rosott stone
i tried everything
and i thought this would be great fun
i'ming choz on
why was it made
it's a fucking or gine
they feel at home
how is it made
make it about the other party
why don't we dcuy this any more
what if the exact relationship between love1 of breenhouse gaffs and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of the changing climate and our sett of civilzations
imagine duggling a snowball across the topic
indeed we want the isk of making things worse
you see the baby's brain
there were others like myself who were full time
he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not a dirty word
but those surveillance features come at cost
government officis are extremely mad
i have to take a year off
i sid meant to have my women' friends
and that's what
i knew but
they grow crops
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity maner woman
and this is crazy
i just need to do with this
i want to go
every kit gives internatal
there's poteas going on
there's people everywhere
and we evolved on this planet in the contact of all the other animals with which we share
i was like oh thatm was on
and i'm sure the figures are similar oth hundreds
we've just somehow forgotten how to dig
the rituals was remination
how could i come from the nationge
what kind of visu was are these
one billion people
but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
i know it works
but i'm not happy
n' my doctor
even the timy right willy bear
you might get a peace for that
it's just stud thing
i want to know how they impass me
i want to know how i impack them
lots of money
' is waitght
it's the top creditor
i'm going to be so healthy
sporting local economies
i made more money
we've seen the image of our blue plan our world bank
got love waywark
we don't even need that much time do amazing things
ye we she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
what are you shird
so how do we do that
you sayid you're worring more than just hours
that's like finding an extra hour on the day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working away more than full time cous
how ese do we great new ideas
china is the world's traat to signd a poverty programme over the last few decades
i but some of our g anchures probably will
it's natural connective tissue
can we really scale this up
then they had to bring to me in
but you know what the acts with facts are
but now it's turned around
i t' get to therapy
my history wasn't right
without that me that really aren't interfaced with others
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the values in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find the way to globalize democracy or
what national little
he went like the answer
they were arguing with one another about askets to only sit
spreme 4's fallen way down from what it used to be
we can create a global parliment of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleith of new potential for innovation for development
but the questions who will have us
there would be invisible crepacity
of course migration will become even more important
and the change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first t10 people i have the children
because we have the stam so
when i was 1 i didn't realize how was amazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child develop autism
that was powerful
wake your hand
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the hiting earthquake
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift me carry on back from the ground to the cary seal
you couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which bijing h grow didt
going there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformation the climate transmitmation we have to design to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw ofvitting down to me
thats sort of theinate of the eye
and now we want to do a double doupble of the angewa of coming through
and so they took them to some safe place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact whatould happen to my brain
we now have a platform
and my own worlds didn't become
i us this that penety
i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
well we bought one of these
come on men
but there's actually more to story than that
the oil will never brun out
what's different is how molecules are put together
effectively to tarda bolatoryate a complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
if any child is found violating these tools he is severely reprimanding
they even matter
i might militar fat
one would the be assldt with
they signed it because they wanted some form of avenge
the other w to be a bigeball player
but if they don't say in parents the international pressure will be overwhelming
pretyoo
we have the plan
i am thinking of the rut for me
pingring through my body with the fires of my love view
i am talking you by your love for me
remember what i sa my love
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
we mi say that we let's not worry about this
that means at some point it's going to be yourw problem to
how did it that happen
it was a sar an portunar
that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
we can create 18th centralized database that has the same efficiency of monopolies
we can see everything in wikipedia
it's a compositive view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is that possible
nohm wrong's not that we don't how my means
they have bad ideas
then she gets their bosses to ratee how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better my job i just needed upgrading my press
they know you can fail by starting businessos bankrupt or by failing started business at all
because each year the winner has come from a different cribial group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need to showse you electure
and this wasn interesting i was trying to question
i couldn't care myself away from the coverage
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
and others resented this comparison between gay rights givil rights and
we're looking for something more
i do like magic
but you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that might always be the case
we can change our minds
they're completely flat and they're bisically cardbod characters
i got about 3000 li mils
m website
soin then i have been the patiure a lot of people have walked over for me
but there's so much potential
this is about proving who you are and what you can do
broughting oth their men
i went back home and i said dad did i do't know who i i'm
and ended the school
no one to land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
you board the plane
the engine fails
the plane takes off
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
there were no bad joors
how do you get to build those relationships
you've just had a new thing sometimes
so we created a new tool
and poor they all like what
but that doesn't mean that we can't
now that's a very very goodploint
what were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this the way i heard from a lot of how reich people
the answer was no
this is how stuff is made memorable
i got puty into it
do you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous fis sculpture
now i know why i'm here
but guess what
for depression it was foor and enalgh times
what kind of tramam i talking about here
for hpatitis it was also two and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeat stress activation
well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bit
and that's pretty aazing
but eventually they didn't come around
you are here a stonage village
unt it was perfect for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
they're not don neated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just tough expression
there's no other weight
i didn't know you have to have creative control
so what'ce women's experience as it relates to mentoring
so this is obvious right
we now have a more challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis is getting worse day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new productal services is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
ok they'll can to make a mobileu your hunter
we didn't get volunteers
we drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of them
imagine if we had across the country right now in local pa been
i have passionate in my heart
it's just a war
both of them bring imaginations to life and way is that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
we're not yet
has the co hearing movement
look at this preis structure
their facees broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will pay dividece
and in many cases we don't
but we all could
terriplies so often you won't even notice it
that wasn the case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no morear charged before you
and then something falls off the walk
i can call the way
only one percent of the pprilect in farmers
thse your famous
so what can we do
who cares about balon
they don't get their money out
daid my child
she works in aer bed

the boys are up there front you
we have to edu that
they're too busy puttting out daily fires to think it has tradically
