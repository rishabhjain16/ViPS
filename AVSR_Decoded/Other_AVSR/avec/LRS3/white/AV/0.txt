they have a common cold
i understand how this can happen
are you losing your mind
who wrote that
ion't you about you
so why don't we leverage that
it's about the cata
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have the surface
in fact it's more like five percent
it had no choice
we can tell with them
and let me just put this in context
how far away it was efen training
you don't get chance to mess it up

i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
i didn't know where i was
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
so what mother twic
and one of them said we had a grabbary two weeks ago
they make sense of the past
it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
to me it's not that clear
he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
they were unexpected pleasures
i'm colutely not the hard working
and the daughter was exhaustive comparing for her mother
but it's not just china
but that system has tons of problems
but i grew up be canada far from my arab roost
so is what it was and what it can bean
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
i was wrning award
i can stand up and do something
why not just let businesses compete
you saw him at
and want it it keep so
i don't want to
it's an authomatic process
and they don't need to ask for permission

i'm here to tell you the story of crazy lifve a psychological trap to guye's life one
i tried everything
' five years old
that even s more scale farmers can leverage
everything new with woreres out
but this is what i heard from a lot of outreach people
it's just a war
it is the default option
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
they have diversion values
that last one's an actual text message that we received
so why is it
but we all should
they were arguing with one another about access to the oly sites
why is that hard
that's really important
we shouldn't be nationalistic
should i go there
where do refugee hrts to go
one woman feed on trash
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of ourtficial stat
i've tried engaging people
we've seen the image of our blue planet our world bank

i know it works
i want to stand this relationships
thanks very much
she g and support networks
that's not an improbleable tip
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
we took campon off the top of the list as the most interested in america
we part of the same family
we need to see beyond the surface
here's where i said
the ricuals were familiou
they told us about home and replacement therapy
how can i let them down
it turns out the evidence takes other ones
no more charged before you
now abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your cow workers your friends and
i looked at my friend who jrilled deven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
so that's it for now
that's what happened with my dad
why are we kepping over this
we know that every single has a sex
the plane takes off
government officials are extremely mad
it would be a mall and not a par
we're losing a ritual
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
and in fact what had happened to my brain
what about s
i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye
i would listen to the heartse
women are worth it
going to my doactor
what would that change about how we live
it makes more complicated
hent wanted to sit where he could stand the room or he could the plan and sa prse we could get his hands
patriarchy is not boys and men
it's the best way to shut people down an airplane
that doidn't happen to me
why aren't people watching their hands
it's not that they didn't want me think critically
and you walk around and it points the things
take a look at for these
and i was like old amazon
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environments get them to d thrive
wash brought us to this
are the attractive
not what he did
face with absence
we have to answer that
we can see how to do that
but it wasn't just individuals
we've done research
what would happen
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
actually study hormones
d and guess what silicon valley
we can't see it most of the time
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what it core values are
i could make that decision
we all know deep inside with the answer is
i was looking for this thing that only food seemed to look for
nobody comes to get famous
so i looked for furniture
it worked for the oaken hand and it worked in the state of neuter'cam
but remember what i said my love
that may always be the case
so after 25 years i run to fel as thought i was running dryg
i no idea
bo it matters a lot
they want to be part of it
please stign here right now
it goes wrong
you would beuing orders from above
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i felt the exact same way that i deid about the state of
they should do it
mke me lackgh
where should hand
that is not simply critical to our eonomy
so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deeper
when we share ideas we all get more
they haven't yet been convicted of the crime
give me input
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman feminism
you'll never walk again
we have problems that we desperately need to solve
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own world
i love building robots
sustainability has got to be a precompetitive issue
i stud a shame
she wanted to change policy at the government level
and i said i don't know
ande youa that before
what kat of richu was are these
do the same thing at work
not a lot of cannds
is shocking to realize that only 28 of american
i remember what you said to me
there won't be a single moment in the schedule
not a single one
there were others like myself who were full time
but we were still missing a critical alement
they get scared of move
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place i
they have different interests
pretty much everybody else who does pos
after college i desperately needed to find the place to goall home
we don't have enough money
but we're not done that
but now it's turned around
but i don't
nobe don't know that it's homeessseelter
it's a commity ofv age for bringing data into the humanitarian worlds
some people call it daticcience
i didn't talk to them
and they put on an opera all night long
and death has progressed
you want to work for him
this ist how stuff's made memorable
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low levels dru cases on the streets just around the corner from our office intereusted
it should be inspiring
this is giat
go i startedgaing sweat forming on my brown
it's not true
one woman tooot her face
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arabaturists
and here's what you need to n know
without it we literally can't interface with others
that's what it moves you
buildings can be like people
they don't trust the law
there's no other weayght
it impacts sentency
we know that we are right there arerong
it's a compositive view that's constantly changing and being updated
i mean how do they form
wh there is a self fulfilling prophecy
that's what texting is
i'm a doctor
take a moment to say thank you
we're going down to the cellular level of these days
so to someum e if we could offer a hop quality education to everyone around the world for free
and if it's completely ok what's the joke
so that's exciting
we connect more and more
i mean everyone did
and then at 1'clock he stopped talking about these del issues
we push and pool and pok and both things
why are we embedded in social networks
u sporting local economies
for african homgrown science fiction can be a will to power
it's look stu thing
this was when i was in texas
this natural connected tissue
i leve cycles of light and darkness
i'm a fifth generation texton
so what did they do
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on back from the ground to the carol ceth
it is my belief that to create these rare game changes requires you to pull off at these
let's help them have a voice
i am full of contradictions
but i'm not happy
i am pushing and pulling with this object
it was always very small
go just six people
the answer to that question is very definitive
and so knowing that we went to the advertisement council and we asked them to help us
and that's plly meedium
the worlds companies governments and nonprofits have delivery armiess that are fully capable of covering this with
i feel guilty sometimes
they could hit the jackpot
when in the history of humanity has ever been possible for one person to rob what
how do i get through the hardest part
youe got unlucky
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
it brings people together and supports creativity and social cohesion
think were go well
i will not be plained
so we need the solutions and needse people play the game they are trying of
i was talking about interaction toesign
take a look at one of our spots
they're too busy putting out daily fires so think it had tradigally
make it about the other party
whos going to inherit his name and his fortune
but you know what
we were obviously making a difference
how togin with family
i wasn't very good at weed things
he told me not to tellly one
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political righting
it's actually not that hard
at what point did i think that was a good idea
there were no bad shors
and it is important
how do you get to build those relationships
but here's the thing
there's people everywhere
what makes technology useful and usable
i have passion in my hearts
and then something falls off the walk
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
this is a crisis is getting worse day by day
it is not have put down of anyone
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
go i would never want to do that
any spoken language that is used by real people has them
it's not one way
let's think about your ethical footprint
we have no suspats
and she's looking at young a the everil
i will not forget the day we got that text message
i teach at stanford
it's like once again there is the whole problem of dying being oftim understood for ust
and these things i am saying take my picture
it was the coldest i've ever been
how oldn
and that's what we did
so i decided to focus on neing data and analytic to help make their most critical decision
and i said to myself i want to get me one of them
effectively the tara boloryate a complete blackout of any other source of information
now that's a very very good point
we have to turn that around
i don't mean giving up the internet
i needed an education
i said we work together
i realized course that all countries are unique
and they sa i wouldn't work int them pover it but what would it mean about my career
no one onland had any idea that anything gone wrong
it's not what i had expected
the same is surrounded by a bunch of stakes and sharks
she was incredibly high
the question why did she said
doesn't happen very much
the simply important is fallen way down from what it used to be
you don't do much chaling
you board the plane
they have to be able to teach us something as well
we'd love to help
and i got pretty into it
some of them were really afraid of contention and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
which means take my camera
and i thought what am i thinking
we are the philosophers
they know you can fail by starting a business to goost bankrupt or by failing to started business at all
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
at the same time
he's a bad guy
it should not have been surprised
it's a performance venue
buts you thoght for everybody to learn how to read the way
we went again women get angogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
but there's actually more to the stories than that
but you know what the asked with facts are
what are the researchers learning
it's not exactly rocket science
to find a goal
that means at some point it's going to be your problem too
how do that processor
but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
and when we do the results we are often surprise
not how much
you don't want this
an no
and the way to do is through the bloodstream
i couldn't care myself away from the coverage
how could i come from the nationge
and doesn't matter
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
i feel that god knows me
he said where is he now
i know i have
but things have changed
which incelli is only a third correct
because we can
what is that
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shamed
if that i right very bar
so what happens next
the boys you up there for a year
now hemilton was everything madicine was not
a he had no choice
you should be have money
young people as well
so i'm not saying that saying the workforce is the right thing for everyone
china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available v agriculture and it has massive
maybe me feel smart
there's a flip side as well
you are here in a stonage village
we were making what was invisible visible
i'm not a military rat
but for too many women that's not the case
thanks for aking
i have an idea for saving the war
so i learned never to move
that's nothing special
in someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserve so much more
how do you get informed
that's my question
even w it so hard
who cleans up a for us
just think about it
and i thought we should just say home
prety cl
thank you very much
let's it's hard
you don't have to bring in waters because the washer driner are free
make it sroway
how should we work
i don't know
i don't understand them
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
they're looking and looking and finding love
we change the economics for the bad guys
i went back home and i said daddi i don't know who i am
that's the work that stands before us
and that's what we said
tick it health tender violence
so they won't go for a while they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
we have the right to respect
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
this is debatee about words about metaphors
m t10 degrees below zero
they not being shipped up peter
that is the real world and unless we find the way to globalize democracy or
so when i started my job at the onoral foundation i came actually looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practiced medicine continues to
and to do so we've had to believe and impossible things
there's a million of a ways to eat peace
i know i was one of the first ten0 people to have this surgery
i was able to do more things
he's like a pece of junk mail to be thrown away
i struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
at some point i'm going to get out
so that's mobile mipulation
make it go it
we have to decide what it means
let's go back and visit our equation
it wasn't like them to mispractice
thank you very much
so this is not this slogan from an inspirational poach
it is in the water
we have to fix our education
she's got better
we did' get volunteers
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
h kindomy won't work and thomas jefferson saying that people won't trust that
i tacked along with my neighbors
i want to go
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer pationent with massive jkes of chemotherapy
who wife leuckt you
even that was't deenou
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survival of all forms of sexual abuse including three
it's very hard to get of course
or a fire fly
we lost valuable data
but the second of the transformations the climate transmationions we have to decide to do
she said yeah
first to live down this political parties
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
growing up i was always intrigued by how people think
how should be then
that's different from actuallyving an in effective idmp
how else do we create new ideas
it was also the first precon to call me a feminist
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
why didn't you justcome me that
what can i learn with you
and it's powerful
they want their treatments
this is possible
it'll have an ithing
isn it about equality
and i couldn't get this information out
has a co heuring movement
one woman scrapped herself
it's the top creditor
they wk together
and after that initial prototype we set outed to make free and open sour software so that others do not have
and 67 of people come back
but i'm a big fan of you as to person
this will pay dividance
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
and i was really scared
they supported me all the way through it
he went like cancer
can we really scale this up
that's next to impossible
it is completely go
where would it go
china is the world' trad de signding poverty program over the last few decades
and imagine what might happen because every reason has something to offer
and they also knew that they could happen to a workforce
so that only if you're paid by the hours
otherwise millions more will die
agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
we have the plan
you doing an incredibly important work
this is ant information
and the problem we worth solving is what are those things
it's about proving who you are and what you can do
againet's displayin
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i want to be the stuy of attention
and nothing happened at all
i didn't fe like i was in the wrong body
i am thinking of the rut for me
we had the battle between jefferson and camelon
now we allways specialitgies combining the digital technology and imagine
so what was i going to do
he was smiling and we said go
we're not as part of the same species
they don't have meaning
thank you very much
you should try it
they were sitting and forever
again in a car
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
if you want this experience to live on as something in story the as the p receptions
terrists are doing this
you need to be have to do something with it
it's sheed no blockges
moor trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
how would i know what i was doing differently
i got about 3000 miles
just when that's the last thing you want to do
so since then i've been the pi and a lot of people have walked over me
of course we are going to go even deeper than the human body
i don't look at for up
why is that
the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
storiestelling is so important
we don't consolt you we don't use fet deal
i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
i'm not sure what it was
and that might have been the case
and so let wass perfect for something like that
because we have stem cells
after all it wasn't bit unconventional
and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
and they did it in the good fast a way
i want you to deal
this is not sense
you might get a peace plack
and they were basically having fun
up and i felt allld this
they were wonderful people
well we rejected all of that
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
that will change everything when you see that
especially when it comes to climate change
and in fact it probably wants
so what do you think happens to theseig cal
i want to know how igh impact them
we've all done with
as an inventor i tran and turn fantasy into reality
we imagine
but that doesn't mean that we can't
indeed we won the risk of making things worse
so once the church is often is actould
the children were killed on the spot
texing has a 100 open rate
what were wrong
that's the badch
i'm not swd
it really is quite phenomenal
we're blessed with people who listen to us
you don't wor about how comput this work
and that's home
what about manipulation
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
i thought this would be great fun
and i fried
they also monitor the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
that whatn't the case for me
that's not to say it's impossible
i had to have faith
we go out there and we copy our cars and we drive from place to place
they gorgeous and head torun brilliant girlsrough our whole lot of brave
75 of them are women and children
most indendent media would shut down
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
the same tool that united us to trople dictators
one woman looked her head
what we want what we aspire to is the codes
it is about crime and violence
i made more money
it's just not possible
gam on men
i know you understand that
what can i do about it
there's poation going on
and that rbts to this project
one way around this is to draw pictures
but i found one
when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was petrified
and youth is what creates impact
this' going to become really freaking and obvious
the i are you so obvious right
ow why are you
how far do they reach
and now we want to do a double double of the age way of coming through
this is a real mystery
let us have a hong kong nearby
we suspended our values
it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
that's available right now
and then i thought this got to be a better way
my father worked atis factory internet
testing has developed one from this slash
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
so bear with me
we need portable health benefits
know they do pol right
danaplies so often you won't even notice it
and all of these matters are grazly because we're probably safly to me is the most important function of
so what is an idearoying
it's a wind all around
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just avrock in afghanistan
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
i do like imagine
we take less notice the fiviion matters
did you care here his own mind
so they felt safe to come there
so what can we do
but you know what
but it's also an important date for another reason
and this routue went on for some time
we don't need more to long to continue
mortality is not going down it's going up
i was going through a hot time as well
so when we met chalk with the senior in high school
i had just graduated from harvard college
we've not since we were babies
so they added oxygen to methane gas
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
she never had to stucknd cover under her dead at school

one year i came up with a bright idea
i have free sons so i see how they fight
1836 people died
they get scared to walk around
they feel at home
that would not work
so when you're born you can make feelings like commness and
so the leadership about humiliation
why do i believe this
how do youook for sure
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
we just need to act on it
that doesn't probably happen every day

the an ev us fatter
please look at me
but we're not there again

if i get position made
but it's not enough
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave for we most things thats brave ime
the economy needads them
go in there
it's about people
how is that possible
it's the war on go
but you'll notice were not at the stop in the mountain yet
what is the abstraction
you take them away disease comes back horrible reuse
how do they operate
and she suffere so much
so naturally i asked what isafic
and when were unprepared we overviaet
let me give you a simple commercial example
it's been thought about for a while
it's kind of the anti reality tv
we met men where they were at and we built a program
pick up the keys

sometimes it goes further
i was no longer harmess
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
well i want differences this mad
what kind of traumam i talking about here
so how does this work
how are we going to do that
and we couldn't just turn it off
it's about systems
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking that people
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
i take get to therapy

don't you a bene thing
but that really isn't true anymore
id you learn to wrch your hands at come
so it's the demand that brings them to the taptures
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a momentring
but there's so much potential
and work like a doll
we were so excited
