they want to be part of it
m and say i we working for a ha people what therou my career
i don't know
i'm a doctor
we do do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for turniture
why is that
what difference is it make if talk about jerry sig fell
flow what difference does this make
now i will maintain it
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
mice is good
who always reminded me of home
it wasn't like them to misspractice
1 percent we get to do that
i didn't want to
i said inherrabic
after college i desperately need to find a place to call home
theyak him the jazz mark
was it begnd this and the enemy
i know a principle right now
what's the abstraction
you're not quitity now
it's so obvious
and they put on an oospital all nech canaer
that's what moves like
i know you understand it
i had an idea for saving the world
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of an anti reality converning
and it's hard and it takes courage that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so naturally i asked what is affrically w
and it doesn't work
it took six days to deploy a global malware campaigns
it should be inspired
how do you know for surely
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply cit to be hor
andre mer you had experience with this
in other words it's foreignercas find these things whhas dly table
what can we do in all of us
roughly 300 savings and mous roughly 600 sis
what do we do to here
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i am going to say awome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
patriarchuing is not always and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual wis including three
and guess what silicon valley
i've tried to engaging people
and they also knew that they could happen to a workfers
i don't know
but we with a gr late to tex
people starting a good idea
and that's actually what happened
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
out toginer with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
would you train them however to adjust caution of according to where they are
he wanted to sit if when you could scan the room or you could get them grand escaperathed h it you could get his hands
and that s exactly what happens
i dember call was
we need to be able to do something with it
we was always trying to make it faster
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand to brings them to the poterial
there is no more of it
so we did the analysis again slightly different
we paay two to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equation
sustainability has got to be a precompetitive show
even if we get everybody's working on we've got to bees to teachers
so was mother toursa
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have an oil
let me give it a simple commercial exam
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it is given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve the tras
you don't get the same witfnesses or depositions
again in a car
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
i was petrified
not a lot of hands
and when she went to complain to a major he said what
such a horizsone doesn't discriminate
they just do it
they all look the same a microsc i meed to a firstpservation
well i think about this all the time
but now teck out where they go on our tree of life he
it's just not possible
if deanz has put rest
it's happening every day
they're looking and looking and finding li
how are you
i think this is a problem
beeth is reels in boston
it's  too complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
i why did i really have to know about
it's not that they didn't want me to reatequek
you can't run around in the doark
what can i do about it
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walking down
well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
so it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
you're broken your back
then clee here really is knowledge
these guys could be true to their gurpse which was finding whyan guys to
we need to be part of a community to survive
isn't about a qualit too
you all know you decided the answercey
we've been not since we were babies
i started looking at them money care forul
it was about systems
i looked at my friend p trilled second pried weals right on more than a billldion those with the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive moveents are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we locked ourselves ino a rooms for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
well we rejected all of them
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what it's wor value on
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also trained our brains to chune out when somebody else's issue
this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against freshing poverty why
well very often when we think about political change and definedpartent spins
so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete reciue for deep
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplishedow
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just far of the same species
we're fi of the same family
i have three signs so i see how they fight
and i won't damay names but you know who you are
you see it as a disruption of real life and importantly workere
we've all done this
l it's 10 degrees follow zero
you destroy all the hone marrows ancerpatation with massive jses of chemotherapyature
whic she suffered so much
tmove and there friendship and their protection
could be married
the question why does she stay
which is why that iv degree in the wall street job in his bright shiny future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological track disguised one
he kept one in the g love compartment of our cary
and here's where those guns c in
i had just graduated from harbard college
show abused the light of day by talking about it with your children your cod workers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds great until you figure out there it's really going
and when we are unprepared to we overhacted
they're not my children
and i didn nott know what to say
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate itould be locate
on the other hand of statistics it's a subject that you could and should use
so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11'clock they stopped talking about these de issues
you can try it
everything we need of our sursolo
neverlew my mind
how can is that
that's nothing special
again he had no choice
it had no choice
i realize pourse that all countries are eat
just when that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get a chance to mess it up
one of them g caued up in water
my mother was on the line to tell me i got the doctors had found a lum in his stomach terminal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question 
i thought we should just stay home
so we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that god knows me
and wrote that
i tagged along with my neighbors
i need too bra
and i said to myself i want to get rid of them
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
welly it matters a lot
' a gooat ne
he sa a great guy
so i'm not saying that thing in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your job needs to be challenging
the science is that
datid drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated back at tracking technology a logistics company that i worked for
we are not there yting

i will not forget the day we have that text nessge
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not to tell any why
i think it might be a lifeline
that lasst one's an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text top mine
who's up the
i can use it in my company
whatever really that prison where they were born things like that
you'll reconcied lt differences right
they supported me all the way through it
that's something we had to celebrate
since you gotten better
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something is wrong
the nazish infaded the netherlands
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anyo
we'd love to help
locks happins
we have no sas pacts
we took cambon off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
i ran the campon pouise department because of that
and all of this matters great becausere polit sated to me as the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
and at thef other end of the spectrum we're doing it closed to heros job
it impact sentence
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug pieces of the streets just around the corner from our office you trened
it impacts crime and violence
some people call it dada science
and one of them said we had a lroud of or two weeks ago
and they would take a yellow steff and the grat somhing on it and would put it up on of it
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and i couldn't get this information about
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time pincipation they were limited to the locin
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exactame way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking for a lot of these questions and i came back
we have no suspects
now at that time campid new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
and when i talk to judes around in the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
they're like the baseball stous 20 years ago
it impacts on everything
it worked for the opens and it worked in the standard shas
they're just waiting for their day act
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
i'm 27 years old
and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a photo profile for your facebook
what about you
i was going through the hard times lif
i was like what
it's the only part that's betery backed up
woman stres coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results will often surprise
i don't chare it
wealth if you lived a way from people who shouldn't be because unpreductive
they don't represent what our views are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
this economy won't work and thomas jefferson the same people won't trust that
and nothing happened for me
but that is not the case toal ne
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
do you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at cpying their natural environment to get them to private
what makes the heart unique
i want to be the centive of forotentation
ki'id not work cho
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
did you hear heas going in my mind
thank you very much
you whyght not just let mrss compete
and then i thouught this got me a better wayke
well that's exciting
we will not be there
just it's hard
that's the status quoe to that
they can't get what they need res thos gics
just i5 people
there the water seay theres forever
we quite the opposite
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and compensour software so that others do not have
so why don't we leverage that
could we leverage the cloud
on that a best
we need portdable health benefits
how should we work
it is about earning as much as a possibly can up
why should we live
we need to reinvently for organizing
i would never want to do thaty
take a look at these
i mean we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
you don't have to bring any quarters because the washher and dryer are free
it' sort of leadership with humiliation
that where is now
thanks for askking
and they are not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we are matured
but it's not enough
as you built a career
thank you very much
you to stll very much
we need fires
but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bagun

my parents came from termes
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of teutage chens and they wouldn't even walk in front of us
so what was i going to do
that is gredy
constants baker much
so o 
i think it's amazed
and they tried them
i didn't feel like i was in of the body
rev1 or s60 met
so i changed my immediate goal that was with thingss
what makes technology useful and usic
we have to turn that arst
and that lved to this project
i became a psychology researcher and ive devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
so w to charch as often as i fl
how do they operate
why are we embedded social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her motherers
how far do they ranch
i mean how do they form
so we have these peece and family cycles
so what do you think happens to lc gou
once again women get the angent gramnd and know one sh tell the gright' a problem
and in fact it's probably wie
we've done the research
they're often not recognized at home
women are working
mortality is not going down and it's golowing up

and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with yous
we used to have a manufacturing economy which is about a building of boods and products and now we have a surface of

how do you change your behavior
even that much ex
some dad not every pat
she wanted to change policy at the government levels
for theep pee cars
it's more the wery
it's in not sure
we're not being shipped up here
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to use
but it's not just china
where are the philosophery
we suspended our values m
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that l we've picked them up in our own worke
we had drown of blank and it wasn't just iraq and afghanistan
i do believe we can fix what's broken
you don't want to
we got a hard time
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history as the one that we have
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological reference
so we need a system that helps all our teachers as good as the best
i'm talking about teacher
how would i know what i was doing different
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities and are fresh water
are he is not deficient
that was the only way to get anything done
efficiency is forour robot ce
human relationships are not efficient
that's a build right now
that is some take deeper motion when you would want to do that
we have no control o these heres
have inspired the generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had to ducken cover under her desk at school
but it's also an important date for another reason
but before thato ooperation that realized kennedy was assassinated at that part of the
maybe i didn't experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly art of science
'll pick up the keys
i shouldally have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and pulling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military academy
that's the work that stands withf yours
it's an unconscious process
he's an automatic process
we go out there and we hop it our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
in fact it's more like ive percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
they don't have answer
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask the tether for a siple water
they were unexpected or pleasures
or wheres he lft
how much teams tapers
so when we met chuck was a senior in high school
the question for us now is how much can do we makere in
not a single one
i will be back
it's the war on tmple
but i love it for a totally differenceook
they make sense of the patter
it wasn't just indiiduals
what a contrabt change
but it's different
this is not to put down anyone
it's irresponsible
it is wrong
are we grave enough to welcome it
start to walk in the community and it takes a roget scientists to realize that they weren't have
they need a poin
we had more intfuion proess
so they won to go c clock they won't hang out with their friends they won't eet
it pracked open my wall
his name islonaant and he is a edteran vi
and he would hide in the ploset
they want to know how much exercise we go is getting
they want to know how often your dog gets out tide
you this in your mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem with that
so what happens next
i want to worarny you about what you're about to go through
why are' we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
he also had 11 children
not the wife not the kids

so no more measing guys
that acttion is actually not on the table
so it's up to us
i would go in occasion
and this routine went on for some time
and now i'm o frees
most of my friends were taking japanese
itan's always very soon
and nothing
so water or something that scared to you
so i thought why not punish myself
and this became my hndreroup when i was a study
i tried everything
i thought this would be great fun
i'm a two song
why was it admazed
it's a fucking orchip
they feel occurragy
how is it made

why don't need to study the same wore
what is the exact relationships between lesurels of greenhouse gases and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate in our setbting civilization
imagine juggling a snowball across the tropic
indeed we run the risk of making things works
we're seeing the baby brain
there were others like myself who were full of
he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not under the work
but those surveillance features come at the cost
government officials are extremely mad
i have to take a your off
i exist because i have my lien threatnds
and guess what
about you
they grow backs
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by human mental
and this is crazy
i just disagree with this
i want to go
every kid lives near nature
it's corination going on
there's people everywhere
believe evolved on this planet or in the context of all the other animals with wish we share
i was like o the amazon
and i'm sure the figures are similar to other halths

so let's start think
i want to know how they impact in
i want to know how ii can back for me

we don't even mean that there's time to do amazic p us
yeth when she had to find seven hours because there is water on basement she found
why are you saying
so how do we do that
we say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like you finding an extra hour in a day
but you can writeest
and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
how else can we create new ideas
china is the world's greatest anti poverty programe over the last three doctsers
but some of our grandchildren probably will
it's natural connective tissue
can we really scale this up
then they have to bring them in
you know what the actual bacts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't right
without it we literally can't interface with others
my desire to disappearing and was still very powerful
and it is importantrou
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces whre we come together
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize them not to perceive an wor
or any national needer
he wouldn't like the answer
they were arguing with one another about access to the hic sites
the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
we can create a glo parliament of mayors
they arere doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have it
they will be invisible at cassit
of course migration would become even more importate
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first ten people to have this surgery
on we have stem cell
and when i was en0 i didn't realize how amazing it was

it's actually not that work
we lost a valuable dater
that was a huge problem in the eiing earthquake
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the car cell
and we couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing has grown us
if you're ina
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second that the trans is the climate transfitmation we have to decide to
and looking at that pattern
he saw h written down to meay
that'sort of the state of the art
and now we want to do a double double of the ageway of coming through
and so they took them to sound safe place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what did happen to my train
we now have a platfrom
and my whole world did open up
and we desided benefit
i'm a professor and' passionate about education
we've bought one of these
government manners
but there's actually more to the story than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how molecules are put together
effectively the tharaiban create a complete the flatcku of any other source of information
their parrents are so for they have the resources to get them back
if any child is found violating these rules he is severely re repromising

it was like a star trek
that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case

children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
but imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a par

we now have a moralellent that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day

he was smiling and we said god
we've been working together l sence were kids really
itic brought us for this

it's right there for you to find
we only sell you airtm
which means take my camera

one year i came home with the bright idea
we can do be
i'm s sar
i have hooked at the best minomoo to someone for
you made it work for me
we know myy kids don't learn
there was nowhere to play the market
i looked at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the global level
how can i let them down
sometimes it's messy it's always unpredictable
it's always what it was and what it can be
let us have a hong kong ne youby
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get to
i tried everything
we've all heard that kind of story for feed rightth
i wasn't very good at reading paayers
we're on the griid
thanks very much
so they don't have to a rerly on people've got getting scarcce at home
so'll a single moment in the schedule
i don't paint
it's going to become really freaking obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad things
again it will not happen eight
i think everyone did
it needs to happen
is it heavy
we let other people worry about
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
where would it g
you can experience their sense of place
who would i eat
said i goow
the whole internet
i was looking for this thing that only fools seemed to look forward
you can walk around them
all connected
and it's an idea roy
and just go to the tari what's the dug
here i one person is important to you
we just need to keep going
we don't even more as lot to continue
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the top of parfishm t
wese have problems that we desperately need to solve
treat beilla we today the cell phlles taxi internet
don't create solutions topress customers
so what did they do
why is itpking the answer
and not just that
they met together
he was talking about the importance of a croaching voision to men and changing the culture of the locking room and giving
and let me just put this in context
you know what else we did
and that's what we do
when that man where they were at and we go to pomant
why do i believe this
were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of our spots
and i have to tell you com a passion for b data
we were making what was invisible in visible
but we were still missing at a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertiseming the council and we asked them to help us
this is your chance
which in sal is only as third correct
i don't mean giving up the internet
it is my belief that to create these rare game change tos it requires you to phall outhons
there on if you need to know where you are and exactly what time is
we get several things
so they added oxygen to methane gas
the guessed that they used at first in many cases with oxygen
and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
that's what we do
you were born to
of those seven have therow weactrons
but it's a global phenomenon
just think about it
it's very hard to get off boics
we're going to stay with them forever
and that in face is beautiful
and does it matter
i was started to an interaction design
designers asspired to these really great designers
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that i had to thege
you know it's like once again whiches this works  often of design being often is undstrein for art
what we want what we aspire to
i don't understand
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential to servees so much more
fm i set again sweat forming on my ground
for african home grown science fiction can be a will to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writings
i had no idea what i was going to do it didn't work
it isn't the water
it was faulty and most of the time i had to restarted oavering over before i worked
it's a marker of empathyic
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language that's use iy real people has on
texting has developed one from this slah
that's what texting is
and so how does your brain give you that detail
i know why not
predictions are the basis that's every experienceed have
it's using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meeting
i'm toally serious
not what is it
they are the basis of every cach in they you to
so when you're bored you can make feelings like contxs and
well that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we are going to go even deeper than the human body
when in the history of humanity has ever been possible for one person to rob
they also monitor the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we're going down to the ceular level of these days
i struggling to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
what if i had told her my story years ago
after all i was a bit unconventional
they have different interests
but it' is not about fire and grimstone either
it means for youth and it's a new rab tv channel
there is an animated series in the works
and she's looking as young as ever
they have divergent values
thererou are noternal cameras
the economy makes thatter
i wanted to understand who takes the job
all cleans up after the bus
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project
i wanted to get to know about wh as individuals
and this leadks to hondities
but this is the source of innovation
if we're still hungry we might have some more
we're not playing with each other
if there's a maer for wasteing eight piza
but if you want move you'll have no choice but you'll run you down
i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
is one woman no longer believes love will ever find curve
i see now i never was warn and not the other
i will not be plained
one woman raises her head
faced with absence
one woman feeds on trash
spine girls spiral
one woman gives birth to two borders
i will craft my own drama
sickness health tender violence
i'm a cycles of light and darkness
one woman strikes herself
where do refugee hearts go
kesta bombs left behind
one woman never did
we marn when they' apple that he
one woman shoots her face
harvest contaminated tobackco
rhythm is nh silence
one woman gives birth to a baby
wh that ask all of the states to do that instead
my father worked in his factory he said
my grandfather went to this factory
and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
that even small scale farmers can leverage
it is not a statement on mealnutrition or anything else
it's about people
the de get outcome
china is constrained in terms of how much more land and actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
we just need to act on it
i didn't have any idea
it would be a more than non ass party
i had to have faith
our city couldt possibly handle anyone parers
how is that pfortable
they want e treatment
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
we are all responsi
but that's kind of a big problem
so after 45 years that we got the fuel so i was running dry
they were saing him forever
how do i get through the hardest part
so momentum is good
and then what happens
often what happens is you're playing so hard from how do i get through the hardest play
not how much
or a fire fi
please sign heim right now
it goes wrongs
and that's powerful
why does a fallly fishing with life
it's more annoyed
last week l i got 238 pieces of nasting e mail and more
but i'm a big fan of you as a person
dotsy ws thousnd
make me lagh
what are the researchers on name
i know i did it
so i' is jealous
it' like a i'm noral person
and i was was really scad
but i found one
i'mven so obvious right
that's next to impossible
so i went in that direk shop
that is what it uss to have a domain of expertise
was worth dying for
i didn't know where i was
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
and this idea is actually nothing news
one way around this is to draw pictures
it started to open me gnda
thank you for your time

you have bias
if you are asked to estimate the wattking speed of a main and the video for example you're answering
well that's my
hardest your eterernal strength

we take less notice of trivial matters
how frustrated are you right now
we know that every cell has a sex
but linda was lucky
we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum
but for too many women that's not the case
she found us we found her disease
the authors looked at papers written over a ten0 year period and hundreds had to be f fromnal
it showed no bloderges
and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
and then we were alarg to discover something
as an inventor i'm trying to turn fantasies into reality
not when you get long cancerved
no llanton is no fish
and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
we've actually studied hormones
and they wanted to look at the microbves after the transplants
we can't see it most of the time

and he grew up essentially on stage one
it comes out of a place called the gallu organization
you're hearing one preentation after another and youre often representing a group of people to try about how
if you want this experience to live on as something historic that at the perception
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
and i want to make the point that as members of society we can too
let's have that
you don't trust the men
i do understand that
and ever stood that before
it's to devatee about words about metaphors
as  knowough
you' taken away the disease comes back all the diffions c
doesn't happen invery act
it has to stop
what about foo is
and you know what
it brings people together and it's impourse creativity and social toonhesion
they were right
they had their scanned inside up
we are losing a ritual
i teach at stanford
we would listen to the heart
this is when i was in texas
physician practicing with cutting edge technology
and i felt all this
so i would never tell you
it would skip a bee
it would stop
it would start
we can do it again
this just needed to each other
when you go of fr you want to be rich
getting a college education is a 20 year investment
now and all seriousness movies are actu really important
storytelling is so important
but what doesies

the stories are amazing
the lef was of being asked
what if h obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
you got unlucky

how far lay was the fitish line
i am fascinated by those times when nun sey by to eye
soil this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster
otherwise is millions more bill die
so i even read is health help books
i would love to hear them lif
the first lesson is about li liv
ive let me know how it works you
havery now
and i'm certainly not the part of working out
was the first on family invester of years
it has never happened
i was in the the ober student
this is not senx
this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arabblel ju
that i grew in canada far from my arab broots
social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
wh has a great passion is the environment
so let's get started now
i was considered a radical
i was living in my own apartment
i was no longer homeless
i didn't al succeed
why are you really here
and i cried
i hadn't maded do three days
i was winning awards
would you like to create a second timfe ofet
it's been thought about for a while
well i was surprised
i didn not know this
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most needs such grave liestor
some boys broken and i was so young i did not know what boys canam do to break the prl
i am full of contradictions
i'm a feminist i'm a rather bad one
i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
there are gorgeous who had stronger brilliant girls for a whole lotnt of brave
we have the right to respect
i want no part of any of that
i learned to write like them and then i learned to quitez myself
we g far beyond masonable constructive criticism to dissececting any given what it is feminism
it really is quite phenomenal
who hw work inspires you and why
that's different from actually having an effective acces
5 from today
how is that possible
that is great
thank you very much
how much they do
what do they have
they have a common cold
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
if they have age
you make it flow of under and over
i'm a fifth generation texting
pread you do
i guess i'm doing it right now
your wife is left here
i study shame
why areid you bring this up
she said yeah
and here's what you need to know
at what point did i think that was a good idea
andve lost your mind
i made a mistake
it's the best way to shut people down the airplanes
he asked what do we need to do to confilmo female norms
it shouldn't be nationalistic
well there's a stuf fulfilling prophecy
you learn more about how computers works
it's useful for everybody to how to bred that lie
we wanted to keep score
we really look out at how ways it theya young people spend most of their time using do technologies
what is it that he miso
some of' got out of the army and it had tremends psychological problems as i got home
how does that world
that's what so complicated about war
it's not what i had expected
seems incredibly hot
it was up there for a year
we have to inser them
they're too busy putting out dily fires to think ahead strgically
and they don't need to ask permission
that's my question
was this guy talking about
let me illustrate this
this was completely hzarn
that's a terrible waste of time
do that only if you are paid by gowa
wasomething different
you would not work
you're more conscious
it is the default option
and you walk around and it weights the things
you just move away
now it haouen hon was everything not as sim was not
first they found in political partins
and they did it in the goo old fashioned way
they changed from person
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing
we're doing gopfes
that was her fight
he mad a about of fice
75 of them are women and children
she died and support networks
now my own specialityies combining digital technology and
it's almost becoming the syentax of a new language
it turns out the othing falls otherwise
it's a pretty simple idea right
none and these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking without people
he downt epo away
let's help them have a all this
and that's what we did
terris
the side of majority does not re in the silence
we hear the chaoscil war
thank you very much
so they felt safe to come there
i did these work together
that's your grandfathers
we didn't understand the programm
tell rev about that
they were all hight
and morest like a bll
and that's hld
i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
they were wonderfuls for people
the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery arments that are fully capable of covering this
this is possible
even one is so hard
that's what happened with my dad
think it'scared to move
they get scared to walk around
my dad has alzheimer's dise
i'm trying to become a better person
and what i need now is to learnge with you like that
they won the game
and the problem worth solving is what are those thing
so bear with you
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i know platporms i no computers they look me on theternet when i was young i
a digital world charm
what would that change about quality of life nutrition
why didon't you just tell me that
what can i learn with you
det you find the goall
and so that was easier
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
we weren't considered the real thing
so we need the solutions and these people flaming the game they are fing out
so that's it for now
that's all ful lie
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sales surveillance
it's just incredible
i was terrifying
the same tool that united us to topple dictators
that's not to say it's impossible
growing up i was always int trireated by how people change
again let's just play
i don't lve their purn up
thatnd' probably happen every day
now i'm ready for my e europ
i need a education
did i get my upgrading
we must adopt that way of giving back
i'm not destroyed
i was like doer withia
'm five years old
and i thought what am i thinking
it's not one late
and that's what i'm calling for here now
so you want to go to that board youing but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
so what do we do
but we almost fear ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
do the same thing at work
and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that we are taen before something
he said yes
we were so excited
thegreeble people us wn and friendly g nice for life
he s i'm surrounded i aunnt of snakes and sharks
the answer to that question is very definitive
what are your intentions for others
it's all about what you view do forghta
whereas giving and taking a marica inermote free values
and he said we i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products
and we think about it it makes a lot of sense because forarming a question is a really complex
let's think about your ethical footprint
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
he's had a technology conference in flered
nor what do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably have noted
we have to fix the internet
most the kindedia w was shut down
now don't get me b
of course they were to
i could make that decision
that's not as appless
he aboutad number
you can navigate space
you saw him a
makee you feel smart
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
i don't even if it's a real job iitle to be honest
it was the coldest i've ever been
