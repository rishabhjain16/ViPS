they want to be part of it
and they said i wouldn't we them about them but what would mean about my career
bus
im a door
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatment make them feel worse
i look after 20 fe
so i look at foot dion
why is that
what differen does m if t all i sh could just fail
i want differences ma
i would maintain
i think what that means that people just couldn' to seek what was in front of them
f it's good
the poins m get me of home
it wasn't like them to mispracticed
one percent you get to do that
i didn't want to
it's not the carib
after a collegeues what need is findndbincecur
they get the shock but
shes aess af
i mean the crueip right now
what's' theisttraction
there's no question that
it's soo hvenious
and they put on a complyh all that long
tals would moved to
i know you understand that
i have an ideaity for saving the world
we are now very comfortable and imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's not evant can'tid reality evant
and it's hard and it' securiouce but that's why we're lie right
nobody comes to get famous
how would do that
so not just has someone after
and it doesn't
it took six days to eploy a global malntward campaign
it should be inspiring
how can you for sure
we created a danaseu tax
i am seing to my syomaching
that's not simphing ritical the u cama
can i remember we can experience with this
in other words a corder to find these things because this thing's a vinal recipe
we can't really do the cdivation
roughly 3700volved reverencly such a consider con visions
what do we need to do
thank you very much
he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me tostand for myself
patron is not borous and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survival of all forms of sexual abduce including three
gu w s iner con valley
i've tried and engageing the people
and they also knew that they could happen to the work fororce
i don't know
people d talk re
people started loose frommun ideas
that's actually what happens
this is at information
it's consumer fal and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
this's just no structure
how to tell with famin
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what l meants if feel like
when you draink them however int adjust c and' going too rare they
lt want the same we can stand the room or into the plant' same prds weid things ha
and that's exactly what that is
you reember clos
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always tr to make it fractioning
at the same time
we're not go to be able to do that
how would you inform them
so it's sek a man pretyptate conception
there's no more ofing
so we can tens is the kindys likely differentr
we make tw the three times more than my heads
let's go back if it thes ay question
saa ability h got to be a brinant p of
and even ifgh we did the government we've got some masorations
so what is betteran treat
we anscply breaking arouf for impaction
i don't have any youw of few
let me give you a simple commission example
more trust is not the intention eimit this k of
trust is the response
because it's giffered to many other people
we you can do it two people together try to improve jreice
know oth the time when is to that position them
i get it coo
thousands of women started rech allouding me to share their own stories of pain and cacking as shame
i was spectrified
not a lot of gas
i wishe w to a pleae to amasister her and instaid one
dr grsmin is s to dcriminatate
that just twice
they h the same between my croscopp and meets our first approsimation
we i think about this all the time
but now jeck out where they go on countr live life
it's just not possible
it see its as birst streats
happing every day
they l looking and finding love
how are you
and this is a problem
but the jwice in wching
it makes more complicated
you can't hide behind anything leing your own cat
i why not really have to smotke learn
it's not that didn' woman that cricket
you can't run it around you in the tarnet
what can guy to do about it
until the leting stuff happens without thinking about it
don't have walk
let's allk of that confous mute
it's like a pie of charkmana to be throw away
you've broken your back
that g really knowledge
theseuys are can be true to purpose which was un as word gus
we need to be part of a community to survive
it's about quality
we all learn the beside with the answer is
we notsense what were babies
i started looking at them pty carefuuly
it's not about systems
i looked at my friends stlf quy wells riting of more than a billion does for the
it's very hard to make them put a very rational decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with the tremendous courage
so we can lock ourselves in a room for two dets and we try to figure out we' about us together
well we've rejected on all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what it core values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brains to dounter with somebody else's issue
this bat that the movements depanding changed knew when they were against crushing poverty one
well very often we think about political change and defined departments days
so i want to talk to you today but what i think is a much worse complete recipe for deeper
a couple of years ago a group of asic canada decided that we were eating the limits of what we had accomplished
id that's do what i have a creer
just part at the same species
we part the same favrly
i have a result do i see how they fight
and i won't damn names because i usually w
was the is a disruption of freeal life important work
we've fall done this
prisons ent decreaslo zero
to destroy all the both barrow and the excerpatuent with massive toses of pemotherapy
she suffere so much
o sh enough ands friendship theret protection
do webarish
the question why is she to tnd
which is why that i have lle tonally and the water stree job and it is breadsheic future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazyenove and psychological trap and to gy and to leve when
he kept one that the lovt department of a car
and here's one of those conidsoman
i just graduat from overdotage
show abuses a light of day by talking about it with your children your care your friends and
i was not going to crow myself for a s clip
i was just tv experiation i exl tob
and all of that sounds to great until you figure out where it's really going
and we were prepared we don't forgoten
did my children
i didn't know what' saide
we can bic the health of the nlationships around france if we c't after that
on the other hand statistic that's the subject that you could it should you
so just like with the bike and we don't talk about it
that liveing gard this st i's talking about these issues
you is right
everythinglos someone tos that
and i put you my mind
how cool is that
that's nothing special
had nwo choice
it had no choice
i realized of course that countries are wek
just when that's the last thing you want to do
done get talks to mess up
one of them grew up in root
my mother was on the line to tell me that the doctors had felt lmput like a stomach the tmal cancer
choices is don't beest sensees because it's the wrong question
i thought we should just say home
so we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that gindned ba
wote fend
i diacked along with it niborers
me your fat
i said to myself i wouldant to keep me one of them
i feel gittl sometimes
why are't working for them
putting patters a clots
this is what you mean
it's a great cashal
so i'm not saying thing's like the work force it's the right thing for everyone
your dob is thisem was challenging
the science is that
take drives better decistions
there's going to be a new system based on donated back at tracking technology from the logice compan that worked for
but we're not there again
you thin there's a lot of things which just don't have to get all
with thatu can actually tri h your haad found it before crisis can happen
there's a wind all around
it's a commydvage from bring dating into the humanitarian worlds
and that's the big deal for a profession that deni mad
in germany friendis
sure he we going off
four times thepestsivecern
after that ra
who havees it all
it was americanry
there's a flip side as well
is shocking to realize that only 28 of americans
we'll not forget the day we got that text message
texic is 100 open run
he told me not irely what
i think it might be a lifel likeght
that last one h an actual text message that we' received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we need to build the craziest text online
could is nothing in fent
i kem using myself
we have realics about that pon where they were put things like that
he rates thatible difference a raat
they supported me all the way through it
that has something we has a cele brain
it's the oother pace
we're plessed with people listening to us
it' not someeth that won
the cut each in faded con netation
when i get out service im not to be rejected to
at some point i'm trking out
we really don't wantk anymore
wet have to help
blocks have on names
we have no sen matters
we took came to off the top of the let sidem i was interested in american
i ran the claim the police apartment because of that
and all of these patters are crazy because we' probably save to something is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data was by the way the changes don't have and when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on to decidn and anoltes to help make their most critical decision
and at the op oother as the spectrum were doinglqually terrible job
it impacts sentence neo
and 67c of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level train cases on the streets justraft c order from our h office tereing
and about crime and violence
some people call the tacticites
and one of them said we had grabbary two weeks ago
and they would sta a lllow city that would rerit up the gu if they would po up on the borarder
they haven't y been convinced of your crime
and i couldn't get this informationow
they were unbelievably expensive to admin sure they were time consuming and they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justenice system in the united states today i felt in exact same way that i think about this kative
so when i started buch i' was going to go to the foundation i can't imagine looking a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have no sexpects
now at las time came to lu jre was the most interesting in america
and when i talk to judge around in the united states which i do all the time now if they all see the same
they're likeed spak spur it's doun 20 years ago
it compas everything
it worked for the old cas and it wored in the state of loureu'nam
they're just waiting for their da course
for d' expect that because i expecting want
i'm devac at 1 years old
and i didn't o for really small dans like the fact that i love fuchable which is meing
this is not fot profile f facebook
what about son
i was alway three hotd time as well
i think watch
parted's better back dum
woman's here eping up
which brings me to my second boy
i'd like to make the suggestion so we don't need to end for that to make substantial progress
and when we shouldn the reseults with the supls
i don't thin
wealthy that's ripped away from people who should be caught up productive
they don't represent the work on our food sorry
we h the battle between the jeffrasison and c ja
omy won't worry time jeffanns the sision people won't trust that
and nothing happens at all
but that is not a case at all
but that's as too much as science of problems
so i'm in the m
you think the government should read d trouble
and so we need to do better and copate our anual environments get them to do qu
what makes the hard read
i want to be the study of ecer
why it's not working
this is what i'm supposed to actually be able to do
sh you a day andal the b
thank you very much

this is a real mis crap
it was also the irst mess these hormor families

that's quitet pres speaking to us
pleae the not just china
what the fge
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own world
we can draw the blanke and it wasn't just the wrong kind of tex
i do believe we could fix what's bual
we all want to
it got part time ey
i forgive you the  and i do not hate you
but we don't get one that's the wayher we have
how you find a naty stirl
this particular reality was ti inevitable
that's the passion of gelectrical recue
to aned a system that helps all our teachers to be good as the pasin
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagined that my kids are going to live it in time when the most valuable compondities is on fresh water

i have inspired aliteration of for defailers
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had to tuck it ever in her dadly school
but it's also an important day for another reason
but before that cooperation human realized any was a sat toay at that part of
mya experiment on myself without even going it
i do i everything
it's not exactly rocket studies

ictally have no idea why
iidn' talk to them
i am pushing and pull ito this object

we go up here we cpal lars they have a drightful place to place
i everyoneally sourc this
in fact that's more like 5 percent
and we finally figured out a dooor
notings
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other for a sep of water
they were uexpected pleasures
wherest  love
how much can we change
so w we match al was sitre in high school
the question for us now is how much you do we make our
's o one
spat
it's the worater know
but i love it fre don'tally love is
what it makes sense for the past
but it wasn't just senificuals
what are culturalision
but it's different
and it do not be point out of anyone
get responsible
it is wonger
i was brave enough for welcoming
start to walk the beautity and sentifying the sci they we
that is important
we can loveups
don't they w for wh they won't get it with their friends that won't need it
feeling of crect open my world
his name is laen cah of veteranant of vedia hel

i'm not a social problem a
so what i on that
rewardit whatich to ama go
why areon't we supposed to have a connection with every'sitle pin tim
whos going to recoun te the game class of washing

how is it baned
making about the other party
why could we conta this tity more
what if he is scd enough from the p between 1e hou death and planed oly
no we already know the cont quences of a changing incliniment lot of cent of civilizations
imagine's not lings so more across this topic
indeed we want the eston that's maasking the of worseh
you said pp brea
they were outhers like myself who were full tim
and's your badck guy
you love this spotdy
it's the not alterning word
but those surveillance features that we cost
if we con fisions are extremely bad
i have to take a cure off
i sist m h have my woman friends
that guess what
i tell you
they grow crops
and so i think that nature is not of that was not touched by human micro women
and this is n crazy
i just disagree with this
that we you
every liesnature
there's potational go i on
theres play everyhere
we need involve on this planet in the contaxt of all the other animals with once we share
and i was like oh that he was hone
and i'm sure the fes are similar other hundreds
we've just somehow forgotten how to se
the restr was remaic
how should i come from the teion
one kind of resuces all things
what it means to people
but the ma to do the problem is something we need to appreciate it
i know it works
but i'm not happy
noould my oxg
the sig night top
you mi get the bigest splan
it's a nice start thing
i want to know how they compassm me
i want to know how i compact them
lots of money
this just wasaye
it's a stopp greater
i'm not being so healthy
supporting local economies
i get more money
we've seone an image of our blue plan now we' tooo pa
like the lft waywd
we don't even that much time to do amazing that
n we should had to find seven hours because you this water over her basimen she found
with our new sha
so how do we do that
you said you're worring bo th that since0 hours
that's findingx twer in the day
but you can write it
that's even if you working way more than full time hours
how oer regreate to our
chines weld try to secnd profit programe over the last ofw decades
i mean some of underrastchairens probleamly re
this natural connective isissue
can we really scal ourselves
that they had any moreot to me
but you know what the acts with acs are
but now it's turned around
i take get to theraby
my history wasn't right
without te me really are dataffects with others
my desire hadas to disabilitate was still very powerful
and it's important
we can only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in whics those public spaces where we come together
is the world and unless we find the way to globalize the pops or to
we h d c
and we got the answer
they were argu we would work under about accesss s nots
a simplyways fall way out from what us should be
we need to create a global parliament of paers
they' are doing it toget
a huge opportunity and adition of neu potential for innovation for development
but on the questions girl who will lugh
they were be invisible crim aciny
of course my graces would become even more important
i have this changed is gett to be more rapid
i know i was one of the first that people have the children
becausel we have seam stood
i didn't realiszed i would bless like it was
i was able to do more things
whyid my china developxism
that was the power of you
what you shay
it's actually not that hard
we loch a valuable danel
that was a huge problem at the end i earths away
it's about the casa
i'm not strong enough to lift me carry on back from new groundlses the counysel
me you could' just tnd the off
it came from the way which the beijing growedes satay
you in there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformations the climate transfmations we have to decign to do
look at that pattern
i saw right downable
that's sort of the state of the ee
now we want to do examp the deut of the gaggewaye coming through
and so they turned them to s some self place
you sand h this clame
in fact what's the time its my brain
we now have this platform
and my own worlds didn't become
i used beer
i'm a professor i re imagin about education
well we' more one of this
cam mo back
but there's actually most dsocially for that
the soer we've never pdown
whats diiffting is how molecules are put together
effectively their docmolety a complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so booor that they have tho resources theyn get them come out
if any child is found finallyated these tools he is severely rebror party
is that give us a fatoo
it might be a sary right
what was the bloo solding
let's notn it because they want some for be for a fanage
the other one to make bigestball player
but if they don't seem bears the international pressure will be overwhelming
thatsretiant
we have the plank
i was thinking of youic for me
being a grast through my body with the fis of myon vide
i am toalking about you come from
remember what i said my life
and i just kind of know
i remember what you sx to me
we might say that we talk us you worry about this
that means at some point it's going to meet ne yourw problems to you
howar sl
he was a sarge an o portunity
that leads to a very powerfers tove
and that might be the case
thank you very much
would create an central  stataemase that has the same efficiency of a monopoloue
we ne can see everything in wcapedia
it's positiveut that's constantly changing and be updated
and how is that possible
no numberron so d that we don't have howbany means
they have mad idea
thing she getso the posit to rite out creative evive there
i'm the opposite
so people c hear about this study they're like great if i we d get better my job i just ded up creat my present
they know you can fail by startumsessos makerupt or by failing start business tattle
because each year the waer has come from a different credible group
they have to be have a attacher something as well
and that ies to be lct
and this was interested in the abstract question
i can stare myself away from the comfort
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
and other is resecting this comparenlly between rights the civil riots and
we're looking for something more
i do like imagine
you just have to find another turp and look at that up
's not that clean
that may always be the case
we cant change our own boies
e flat andre missinges like har burn characters
i got about 3000 miles
m website
ago have me a picture lot of people have walked over to me
but there's so much ptention
did not improve the orld you and rush to
brought echentthoo matl
iad my home and i said y sid i doon you know one i
like this is tube
no one toland had any idea anythingone wrong
you're born the plane
the actgion fails
the blee tickes off
they dreamed up a variety of horrified scenarios
there were no bad toors
how do youate to build those relationships
you just not to do things and sometimes
so we created a new sol
and poor they were like a witkus
but that is something that we can't
now that's a very really point here
what would wrong
we have to dcide what it
but lens the way i larn through in life how reach people
act it works thank you
this is how stuff is being memorable
and ike unyjo it
you remember what it was
had to do something
this fishing village was famous foris sculpture
now i don't want to come he there
well guess what
for depression it was fuel with the h havefetimes
what kind of trouum w we talk about era
for hpatitis i was also ching half
children and arepecial dentative to this repeatal stres activation
with the pasin walking in the forest i too sep
and that's persci bausium
but efentionally they didn't cae around
you are heer st large village
and it was perfect for something like
we get cibon on the surface
you're not aareully substces
they're not stiated
and newsces will create compact
because we can
i be hadot to jo poetry was just self an expression
that' n of weight
i can do you actually have to have a creative control
so whens women's experience as it resens a matoring
so this is obvious it's reking
we now have a more challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
those years a crisis is getting worse day by day
soll the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters of new productor service a is
we l't have the money
and we all do this
k re to make a mobile cuse
we douldn't getive fueers
we drive around
thank you very much
me tell me a couple of f them
imagine if we had across the countr right now in local plae sian
i have passionate my heart
it's just a walk
both of the bringl imaginations of life and what is it remind us like all of our ponds in the end
i can stand up and to do something
well not yet
has the cle gented movement
look at this pretty structures
their faces broadcast their experiencees
butlds cant be like people
why is that cars
that was she everything with which that
this will pay dan s
and in many cases we don't
but we are as sood
dead replies so often you won't even notice it
that was' the nase of meating
we got the oo' talking about it
don't wark charge before you know

we were obviously maganic difference
take a look at one of their response

that's a shame
why did you put this up
youid k
and here's whatere you're ne to now
at what point did i think that was a good idea
have you launched american

it's the best way to shut people down on airplane
he has one or two women in dert forormed female horms

w really look at how reasons the young people spend most of their time good neoo technologies

some of bot out economics that a tremendousychological problems they've got homes
how does that work
that's what's so complicated about war
it's not what i had psin
so it was incredibly high
the boys dripedow frono
we have to canat do that
they're too bas com pret out and get found to the catition
and they don't need to ask for permission
that's my question
what is this l talking about
let me intstrin this
this is pbalic so
this terble ways of time
so that only if it's pae my hour
now would it be different
was that work
it' s more conscious
it's a default objion
you walk around and can wast and things
it doesn't move away
now amtine was everything that malazine was cot
first and they've down the political parties
and they did it in the cold fas a way
they change from the person supporting
so this' more about tapture the third idea aboutaptute comopentr
sh went to do it ok
that was her fight
she learned about rush
75 of them are women and children
she h suppo network
we oway to be che ased' compispassion
it's almost becoming a sinedaxt of dual language
tnears is now the evidence takes onth the ones
it's a pretty simple f idea right
nin of these studies h found that people spent more h trating or smoking that people
these young people as well
let's help themh haveve a voice
and that's what we sayid
we tell do re
the time the chok is not need to be cycl
we use to for
thank you very much

it los home
i'm be never going to know how you be everic com about
they were wonderful goo people
the world's companies and governments and n profits have to every com itself full and capable of confidence we
this is just possible
if the wek is go hard
that's what happened with my day
thats scared the
they can scare the waterround
my dad's niceus to this
i'm trying to amer person
and we hnd it now if just learn something like that
they want the game
and the problem re string is what are those things
so bear with
thank you very much
what would that change about how we sff
i know played from tpers andn put me looking tim i was younger
and they told the world traime
what would that change about quality of life tradition
why did you just stop me that
what can i learn with you
let's fine good
so that pase
and the wight tost through the plus stroum
we work consider the real thing
so we need the solutions and need people pay the game they had rin cnty
so that's it for now
that's often f like
and one activist sxafanica contract from a western a company different cll saveana
it start thing dream
i was terrified
the same truth i thatid you lit that to drop your that tacors
that's to say it's impossible
growing up i was do was tream how do people thin
again that's displa
how you look lking fore
that doesn't probably can'ppen every day
now i'm try to give for my interview
i gety education
i got my uppper right
we mustl up a weay of deving ba
i'm not swortded
and will find there one thing
if on
eas that would be forg
it's not one brand
and that's what i'm calling for years now
so you want to go to that pointment but you only want to pay attention to the bi interested
so what do we do
we almost don't feel ourselves
when this happensgh we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put not in a great show
we connect more and more
do the stam thing at working
and so what of the major challenges of our process really is to find photographs on the oneay tand before something
we said yes
were so excited
ingred about people to warm but finally anythernsre playe
the same the rapeent for sx chars
the answer to that question is the veryfflive
we are in touchess with others

i weould think about it best li of sex mars formul question is a really complex
let's think about your ethnical foot print
but quite frankly on this issue there is no under road
we have to fit there as oc
' blorring
or do i think we are about ourselves howct like to solve the problem
you're probably waful
we have to trust the internet
most going to make the money that we sent down
don't let me wrong
of course in the will
i didn't make thatke concision
that's not an a problem is up
you know about number
you justn't have it at the speech
i was falking aboutck tim
it mayght be a feel small
how do something i like p feel smart
i don't even know toble job ta this some chink
here was a coldest i've ever been
