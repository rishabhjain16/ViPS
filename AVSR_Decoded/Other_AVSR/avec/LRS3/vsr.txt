they want to be part of it
and that's how i would bring them about it but what mean about my career
i know work
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments make them feel worse
and i looked after 2y that
so or for fornature
why is that
well diver ses me of thatnledge is not failed
but i want differences in man
i want to be say
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
and this is good
the boys are reminding me of home
it wasn't like them to mis practice
you can do that
i didn't want to
it's not arabic
after g sucs were leading as fa polce home
they can get the jackpot
youat the terrible
i'm going torping right now
what's the abstraction
no question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an opera all day long
that you will move to
i don't understand that
i have an idea the first saving in the world
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of hi reality tv
and it's hard and it lakes curds but that's why wouldn't di right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so tch has a really savy
and it doesn't
and the six days deploring our global metowin campaign
it took me inspiring
how you know for sure
we created a dcognize the tests
i am saying to my stomach
that's not simply between all the our economy
and i remember we had experience with this
in other words a quarter to find the change because this is a fital recipe
what can we do with all of this
roughly 37 cs involved in roughly s6 c visions
what do we need to do
thank you very much
he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take stand for myself
patriotalia is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
he has one silicon valley
i've tried to engage people
and they also knew that happened to a workforce
i don't know
people sid not't realize your ku
people started contributing ideas
and that's actually what happens
and this is it information
it's consumer fear and is happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
how does that w have happened
but lies have changed
but just imagine for a moment what needs me to feel like
when you draink them however and you ajust aa according to wealth are
me he wanted suid we could stand the room weere eato the plack and sam brats we get ha
and that's exactly what they is
youb got close
you need to be able to do something with it
were always juck making frenchi
at the same time
we i'll be able to do that
how would you getform
so it is a demand that resecept the deception
there's no more over
so we d the cast in everywhere
we made  three times more than anybody else
let's go back of the hard question
sustainability is to b breeding beigevsue
even if we need everybody wor we've got some ex region
there's no one in special street
we's going to be barqu for compassion
i don't have the uni
let me give you a simple adminition example
more just not the such timm in itself
juste respond
because discovered by other people
we do two people that i try to improve ch
you know what the same what to do that position is
i can't get a car
thousands of women started which allows me to share their own stories of pain and ashamed
i was spectrified
not a lot of gas
i want you into a place a major he said why
sexual who has been seen discriminate
they just do it
they arent the same bety microscope that meks our first approximation
i think about this all the time
but now she out where they go on alternative life
it's just not possible
it see teper to
stoping every day
they're learning and learning and finding love
i want you
and this is a problem
but this is really surprising
but it's more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own s
and why not really have smokeer
it's not that they didn't want to think critically
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
it's a negative stuff happen without thinking about it
you're never walking
but let's hold on how good for just to me
it's like a piece ofark mat to be thrown away
you've broken your back
that really knowledge
these guys could be good on purpose if it very early case
we need to be part of the community to survive
and about equality
we all know to be stuck with the answer is
we've lotten we were payment
and started looking at some re carefull
it's about systems
i looked at my friend could trilled the safest wi whales writing off more than a billion dollars for
it's very hard to make a part of our magical decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we try to figure out what bound us together
well we've rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what core values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brains to do now with somebody else's issue
this man that the movement de panding changed knew they were against dcrching poverty one he
we very often we think about political change and to find department and tass
so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deeper
a couple of years ago a group of inda ka decided that we were hating the limits of what we can accomplish
said that's what i'm living
is one of the same species
were part of the se favorite
i have three sigens directue how they find
i won't cam names because i tell you are
was the disruption of real life the important work
we've all shot the this
but it's standard rismow zero
who destroy all the both marrow and the cancer patment with massive notes of chemotherapy
she suffered so much
their love and friendship and their protection
so we emerged
the question why is she stay
which is why they ev a liter and they walk stre a job and iss brainch ander future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy loough a psychological trap enance  stuff with
he kept one in the loved department of a car
and here's one of those guns com in
i us graduated from overard age
no abuses a lif of day by talking about it with your children your young workers your friends and
i was not going to crown myself f  aslep
i wascev an inspirationar that space
and all of that status s green until you figure out where it's really going
and we were prepared we forgotten
they not my children
i didn't know what to say
we can build healthcare relationships around race if we currently aterli don't cat
on the other hand statistic is this is the subject that you cook it should do
so you want to buy we don't talk about it
the i leve gar that stop talking about these issues
you just tried it
everything goes from one day
and i put my mind
that cs that
that's nothing special
i had had no choice
he had no choice
i realized of course that all the countries that need
just that's the last thing you want to do
you know get us mess up
one of them are up in the rules
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctor she felt clump is seeming the smal cancer
choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
i thought we should just stay at home
so we decided to go to the moon
i feel that unknows me
won't forget
they tx along with my neighbors
be too far
and i said to myself i want to keep one of them
i think you'll sometimes
what could work for him
but it matters a lass
isid what you mean
it's a great god
so i'm not saying the say workforce it's the right to thing for everyone
your job is seem challenging
the rice is there
data drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated back tocking technology from the  justis company that i work for
but we're not there again
you see there's a lot of things we just don't have at all
with that you can actually trig your headfunded before crisis can happen
it's a wind on the ground
it's a comic of age for bringing it into the humanitarian world
and that's a big deal for a profession that's den a mate
the germany free
surely we going off
four times the mass of the sun
we have to get right
you have the organ
how dome do it
there is a flip side as well
is shocking to realize that only 28 of american
and we will not forget the day we got that text message
txa has a 100 pen rate
he told me not exactly what
i think it might be a lifeline
that last was the actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crazy text online
you could not think event
i am doing my c f
we read about their points where they were born things like that
it reke acalable differences trad
they supported me all the way through up
and that's something we had to see plant
this is a young man
we're place where there are people will listen to us
it was just people were
the nasa infad the is
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm goingount
we pre don't walk anymore
we love to help
plants have teams
we have no senemats
when took came to off the top of the latest testma was interested in america
i read that came to police department because of that
and all of these patterns are crazy because we're probably saving to me is the most important function of the
but when you start to look at the data was by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus to design analytic to help make their most critical decision
and at the hypoth less of the spectrum we're doing equally this terrible job
and it my sense
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases and the streets just around the corner from our office and trusting
and about criming violence
some people call it exact science
and one of them said we had graber two weeks ago
and they would take a yellow city they would rit something they would put it up on the board
they haven'tet been convinced of crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to admin term they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i found the exact same way i think about this state of
so when i started my job at an author foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have no suspects
now at that time came to luterseon was the most interesting in america
and when i talked to just around the united states which i do all the time now if they all say the same
they're lzb exzposs down 20 years ago
it impacted everything
it worked for the only case and it worked in the state of lurcy
they're just waiting for their ted cr
the thingspects expect that one you
i'm devented 7 year old
and we colncted over really small thingals like the fact i love lunch small thing which is me
this is started a phot profile vish on facebook
what am truth
i was gowing through a hot time as well
i was what
there is the only part of spect at time
woman seeres c coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make this suggestion that we don't need to for that to make substantial progress
and when we toould the search wor of the supplies
i don't forget
wealthy it's riped away from people who should be caghtonproductive
they don't represent the work our infuss on
we g the battle between 70 and
w say me won't work nam shoving the s that people won't dress that
and nothing happens at all
that is not the case at all
but that's in to man signs of problems
so what happened to me
you think the government should reis trouble
and so we can do better and there are actually environments get them to the way
what makes it hard to read
i want to be the center of attention
why it's not working
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
tea you again and amat
thank you very much
why don't just la businesses in complete
then i thought this got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we would not be there
that is hard
that's the stat quote today
they need and what they need when they need
i feel good six people
this is the water taken forever
quite the opposite
and that e where
and after that english prototype was set out to make free open source software so that others do not have
so what do we have to share
or we haveverh loud
that so imagine
we need more health benefits
how should we work
it's about her as much as you possibly can
how should we live
we need to reinvent them organizing
i would never do that
take a look at this
or we don't know it own we
you dontve to predicting wds because the wash t and all free
so here's a better action
where is it now
thanks for asing
and they're not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we are magic
but it's not enough
i've built in korea
thank you very much
there's about money
we wouldn't tell you anything
when i w to we as our hands with ppp pa
so somewright if we could offer a high quality education everyone around the world for free
that go from really well
we can open up the car
and they've meet the robots
what about manipulation
so that's mobile population
i didn't want one so badly
we need to identify with the opinion
that it happened to me
magree it
but i can do it
but i can do it
thank you very much
i said this is just about a breck bake
but here's the thing
i don't know
that's bay
it was the market
we can start pointing an entire layer of digital information on the real world
my parents came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
so what was they going to do
lck is the right answer
constants bear my
my old loo
fin keep potential mae
are they attractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
i went h to si my abus
sor i changed by aming called 10000 faces
we'll make technologyso usable
what' still happen to that was
that's our piece of this project
became a pychology researcher and if the vote my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
so when the church is often exactness
how do they operate
why aren't we better in social networks
and the daughter with a toust of spat for her money
ow farer that range
how do they form
so we have a differentive famous stycers
so what did happens to the act
once again we begin to engineering min and we to solve this they have a problem
and it around the really world
we have done the research
you're often day read this say no
women wereth it
we sci is not going to now it's going up
she had to in person like a man
so thank you for your attention
c bor re possible
not enough to be on about this
do anyone
and which i did the decu the favors
and the great thing is that you take an i w along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was by building the goods and products and now we have a serfa
you will be tooing orders from the above
but in fact he found something very surpressing
but that wouldn't dog anymore
this is really ma to
it was also the first person to call me a feminist
my brother said this is interesting i
not i am
i can change your behavior
and that wasn't enough
some s not every money
so we need to change policy at the government level
it the change
it's a hot country
it's not obstacle
can be stripped completing
and what was the result of that
and that's what i sper patient is speaking to you
but it's not just china
we are the  activities
we can spend our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own world
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just the roq and afghanistan
and i do believe that we can fix what's broken
we all want to
he got ball cam my
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we don't get we can do it that the one we have
and you fix a dining story
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the passion of the geological record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be took to the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagine that my kids areing to living a time with the most valuable commodities of fresh water
are is tevision
that was only way an thing did
f is for robots
human relationships are ofvion
that's developed right now
that seem deep deep emotion when we want to do that
we have no control of these forces
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important to see that you know that right now we have over
she never had a society never her dent in school
but it's also an important today for another reason
but before that cooperation could be realized lad it was dednay at that part of
maybe i did experiment myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket science
you become the cider
instead of doing a way
i talk to them
i'm pushing in bulling with this object
my research team i went to the  port military academy
that's the work that stands before us
it's not a go to process
it's an other mentor process
we do have we comic causes and we right from rea place
everyone doing this
in fact it's more like five percent
and we found the verysues
and we have an idea
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
streeters mi as each other for s tip water
they were unexpected pleasures
or else in love
how much can we change
so when we metchow was a senior in high school
the question for us now is how much can we make our feet
that is one
i will be back
it's the world'ser
but i love the frie i reallyve focus it
that makes sense of the past
but it wasn't the individuals
for the tradition
bing is different
it is 9 of it
i can't respectible
it can work
i wouldn't prevent it for wecming
started to walk in the community and incignivating scientces of he said that were
they is support
we had all  the bors
don't they work for a while they won't get out with their friends they won't need it
f l end open my world
and name is psdeogya veteran of vam
she were hiindlasting
they want to know how much exercisors are excited
they want to know how often start get outside
are you did you're bay
so this works what happens
i'm a social problem now
you became a sen
half wouldn't be which mysel throu
ow why are't we supposed to have a connection with every single painity
als going to allow same kind of watching
he also had he have truth
god wait forgh kids
it shouldau have been surprised
we're going to
so no more misicide
the option is actually hat arou on the table
so we kept the eyes
but we go in our connection
and this is really  are for some job
and a of languages
most of us will like japanese
it was always very small
you d se
so wer with something that i'm going to be with
ratheran what i up myself
and this became my ely career mroenst
they trink it with
i thought this would be great fun
how much you talk
why was it amazing
it's a funny orge
they feel home
how is it page
man about the other party
why don't we stuck this anymore
what if aquluip between love of greenhouseat and planetary
no one already know the consequences of a changing cligimate longsenter synthises
imagine suckling a fillld ballld across the topies
indeed we want the risk of making think of words
you see the baby's brain
they were others like myself were' full time
this is a bad guy
they st thre love spot
it's not an alternate word
but in those surveillance features come lost
if we a mission to this would be badid
i have to take he off
indeed me to have my women friends
and guess what
and you know what
they were cupted
and so i think that nature is not in that which is not touched by humanity micro woman
this is crazy
i just disagree with this
that we go
every gives in nature
there's pollination going on
there's people everywhere
that we can evolve on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
and i was like who name was her
and i'm sure the figures are similar other houndres
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
the wrbs were remained
how did i come from ni
what kind of visuals are the
what million people
but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
i know what it works
but i'm not happy
so to my child
it's a likerplain
we can pace with that
it's kind of stuing
i want to know how that impacts me
i wouldn't know how i impact them
lots of money
this is why
it's an operator
i'm coming so happy
it's importing local economies
i made more money
we've seen an image of our blue play our world back
it's leuw work
we don't even care that much time to do amazing things
now when she hk to find 1 hours because this water all over her basement she found
we all know sugar
so how do we do that
you say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like fighting exxtra hour the day
but you can write it
and that's even if you work away more than full time hours
i want to recreate new ideas
talking to a word truing secnd poverty program over the last threew decades
i mean some of our direct showres the problems really
the sexual connective tissue
that was really
then they had a point to me
but you know what the actual facts are
but now you turn around
i can get therapy
my history wasn't right
without someoneity really all datterfected with others
my l ip was still very powerful
and it is important
we can only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
we need to tcher c
i would like an
they were h we would one another about assets and holly us
simply moreways far away out from what you should be
we need to create a global parliament of bearers
they can do it together
a huge opportunity and a legion of new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have it
they will make visible capacity
of course migration will become even more important
and the changes getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first tim people to have this curgery
because we have the same tool
and when i was youning i didn't realize how blessing it was
i was able to do more things
why my changes of oeroperism
that was the power of
where do you cheat
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the end and old the way
it's about the king
i'm not strong enough to live me carry on man from your rift caryotanh
i you can just sit it off
it came from the way in which bud control city
you know what
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but in decaliveity transformations climate transformations we have to decide to do
and you get that batter
it's kind of acceptable
that sort of a st of e
see how we want to do is a more temple of the age way of coming through
and so they turned them some saf place
understand how this dileama
in fact what's happened to my brain
we now have a platform
and my words can o become
i use it that person
i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
well we put one of the
cam on man
but there's actually more to goo than that
the world will never without
that's different is how molecules to put together
effectively the dark biograin are complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so prety they have no resources shan them
in any child is found vinolating these tools it is severeing reprebonding
they even fatter
might be sar at
what was the best soldiers
theysided because they wanted a form of for advantish
the other one is my baseball player
but if they don't sell any parents the international pressure will be overwhelming
it's bit new
we have to plan
i'm thinking of your love for me
and pain quests through my body with the fires of my lun file
i am toking by you up for me
remember what had done my love
and actually kind of though
i remember what you said to me
we might say that we start to worry about this
that means at some point is going to be your problem too
how does that happen
it was charge anymortunity
that lead us to a very powerful tool
and that might be the case
thank you very much
we create a endentralized database that has the same efficiency monopolies
we can see everything in wikipedia
it's a compositive view that's constantly changing being updated
how is that possible
come a ron today we don't have op aty mises
they have palaces
the geness de bosses to write outreat of cavative there are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i weant to get better my job at just siting up gradmate brssel
they know you can fail by starting business cos bankrupt or buy felt in start business at all
because the winer has come from a different gradble group
they have to be teaching something as well
and in that i g a social lesson
and this wasn't just i'm try question
i can share myself away from the comfort
african americans supported at a higher level that had ever been recorded
and others rejected this comparisces between gay rights and civil rights and
we're looking for something more
as you can imagine
you just have to find another term and look at that up
somebody is't not that clear
that might always be the case
we cannot change our minds
they are completely flat at the best of the carboar characters
i had about 3000 miles
mother website
so since they gave me a picture of people have walked over to me
but there's so much with cancer
this is about who who you are rich into
watching notmace
i with my home city sayly i don't know what am
and this is tb
no one had laked that a list anything had gone wrong
you bought a plane
age fries
the biggest thing to have
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
there was no bad tools
how do you get to build those relationships
you've just got to do things sometimes
so we create a new tool
and boy they were like read
but that's something that we can't
now that's a very veryt important
we were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this is what i lard from my life i reached people
the answer was
the sounds of this made memorable
i got money into it
do you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fision village was famous fish culptter
now i don't want to comes here
well guess what
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of grew up we talk about here
for hyplotics it was also two and a half times
children are expressally sensitive students repeat stressactivation
we imagine walking on the forest and you sipping
and it ls pretty amazing
but eventually they did double out
you are either a st he finish
and it was perfected for something like that
we can sleep beyond the surface
they're not avidly upstairs
you're not ok
and do this we creat an impact
because we can
i began to poetry was just self expression
there's no other wait
i you actually have to have creative control
so what women's experience has it resnded to menduring
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently matters of a year product to serviceit
we don't have enough money
we all know this
okay we can make a mobile catgater
we did't have ol disease
we can drive around
thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of different
imagine if we had across the countr right now a local place has been
i have passionate my heart
it's just a wall
both of them bring imagination to life in ways that we mind us like all of our bodies in the end
i had to stand up and to do something
will know that
as an order and movement
or at this particistration
the faces broadcast their experience
but these can be a lot of people
why is that art
that we start a conversation with we d agight
this is where paintents
and in many cases we don't
but we are certain
day replies so often you won't even notice it
that wasn't nice of me
we all know what he's talking about is
don't war charge before you
and then something falls off the wk
i call the way
topment o the people in the moment
so you find
so what can we do
who hears about burning
they don't need their money else
that my child
she wasn't still pain
i believe the story there has to be told
i have to report
so the very first thing we wanted to do is this beauty was look at the health system
and he said oh this man absolutely yes
it was smi and i would say no
we have been workingother cies which is where iistory
what's product it
well  chat
it wasn't who i was
here's where i stand
i don't have m
theys what we call
that's all i did
to prove it
why the drugs the car
they go frs the alarm
but it's not true
we got to saul we got to feing
so what so that
but i need your help
what did he say
you condacting anyone everybone was felled by my plant
they've mep
there's nothing ungrounded about it
it's right now for you to find
we only tell you what a time
which means take my camera
i said the first tw ministry of juw
and the same childs had my pleasure
i wrong
why are we coming over this
this is a really important job to me
i wasn't that a relationship
i want you to see
those are incredibly important one
and so many of my carrent memories involved and changed crips around water across borders
one year i came up with a bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the mest that i've learned some of the words
humanity walk for me
we know what it got look

there will be a single moment in natual
and so pained
it's going to be a pretty fe obvious
so how does this work

andone if you're completely ok what this phonet
i'm one person talking to you
we just need to keep going
we don't need more tg in the u
i think we need something like about ad project on the topic of artificial cancer
we have problems that we desperately need to solve
three million people 0 percent fed ac inla
no greate tools to embrace the custributes
so what can they do
why is it important now
and not just that
that makes it they know
and it was all about the importance of coture poisons in men and changed the culture of the lock room and even
let me just put this in context
and know what else we can
and that's what we need
we met met when they were at and we built a program
why do i believe this
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of these spots
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still missing on a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
it's your change
we shouldistic is only thirduar academic
i don't believe it them to hereterday
it is my believe that doingate these rare objects requiresableull of at theast
what you need to know where you all and exactly what common is
well it's several things
so they had an oxygen to method ak

that interface is beautiful
it doesn't matter

i sa it once again this whole problem ofenb ofs psental schoo for us
but we walked when we inspired drs and code
i don't understand them
s notind of ouristic potential so much more
no i go again towin for me in my brown
for african who bot satce fictionally be winged power
stage visit is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political right now
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
he's in the water
i was fouting most of the time i act to re started over and over before it worked
even a mark of empathy
casual speech is something quite different
and un spoken languages used by real people ask them
testting has developed one from this slash
that's what tess
so how did your brain give you that system
i know i have
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
it only past experience based in similar situations try to make meaning
i'm totally serious
what is it
the healthy basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like copist and
that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we're going to go inven deepat as the human body
when the history of humanity has ever been possible for one person to rh
there's the months on the internet and social media to monitor the progress i
we're going down to the ceogove of these days

take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project with them
i wanted to get to know them as an individual
and this l tau is
but this is the source of innovation
if we they're hungry we might have somem
we're not playing with each other
there's in the middle of way at pits
but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to read your cow
i meant to extreme plath to try to be state

i would draft my whole droum
sudence health attention of balance
and he was titears of l and darkness
one woman's draped herself
where refugee also

that's more expensive
maybe not
what are the researchers learning
i had no idea
so i was jealous
then i'm a normal person
and i was really scared
but i found one
the honor is so obvious right
that's next to impossible
so i went in that direction
that is what they go to have so many of expertise
which were dying for
i didn't know what i was
raised and social category that has staggering biological consequences
i'm also want this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
and this casea has done nothing new
one way this is draw pictures

turk sample was actually 1894
but less notice if you living matters

but this was a study
we have the tools but we lack the collective weitland moment
butficion or many women that's not the case
she found us we found her disease
the authors looked at papers written over 10 year period and hundreds had been thrown out
and genero blindges
and it's an issue of the quality and the intgrity of science and medicine
and then we would alarm to discover something
as convented i stras to the fanttestya reality

you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
if you want this experience to live on as something a story that has you perception
so i'd like to leave you with these signs
and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
let's have that
we know the trust about
i do understand
i never said that before
this is a mate about words about metaphors
i don't know
sa them away see comes back horrible
doesn't happen very much

and it is a sa fer
what else to doe
of course we own the densers
i'm phsician practice with c engage technology
but fa certa is

what obesity is the causest of itl resistance at all
she got of it
but you know what
but you know what
how far we receive the trick
i am fascinated by their time people who do not see and i
so this is not the learning from an inspirational approach
otherwise millions more will die
i even oneon please care of our boos
i would love to hear from you
the first inon is about humanity
try to i meigure how it works for her
i you know what
i absolutely not the hard of working
i was a first young family inventor game ston
it has never happened
i was a mediocal students
this is not sex
this is just one inffect of a poomic centurd across the arab region
but it took megan far from my air approach
social change is happening in the our bridgion through dramatic conversation
they have been taled by their families offers to wealthy arab stories
about a year after that 11 researchers the damaged a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the word
but the great passion is the environment
so let's get started now
i was considered a wilder
i was living in my own apartment
i was no longer homeless
i didn't know what to do
why are you really here
and i find
i had pain recouction
i was reading awards
would you like to read the chat one together
it's been thought about for a while
i was the press
and they start to us
and i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we personz and braayvery
some boy has broke me when i was so young i did i know what boyss of splay gir
i'm full of hnd traditions
i'm a feministm they were round their backround
i enjoy fashion magaine is a breat fun us
they couldn't cquch just class you are brilliant girls who aren'tw a lot of brave
we have to buy respect
i want to know part of any of that
i learned a way like them and then i learned to wait as myself
we go far beyond reasonable constructive iticisms to l d dna even woman feminism
it really is quite phenomenal
you want work inspire you and why
that's different from actually have any effective that numb
how was i saying
thank you very much
that is okay
thank you very much
how much they know
what do they have
they have a common cold
second is you can put lots and lots of teats very small because they
you can have the answer
you make a flow hunder and over
i'm going to fe the generation's next
what do
i guess i'm doing it right now
wife lived it
it's not a shame
why did you put this up
she said ya
and here's where you need to now
at one point i think that was a good idea
have you launched your mind
i made a mistake
it's the best way to shut people down at airplane
he asked what older women in cerity new forms of female norms
we should beigally listening
we're seafulfilling privacy
you learn more about how to build this way
but she everybody she looked'ted right
what is it keep the doo
what you really look at now is that the young people spend most of their time social technologies
what is the time message
some of got out of the army ex tremendou psychological problems when they got homes
how does that work
that's what's so complicated about war
it's not when i had expected
she was incredibly high
the poys dropped offrend
we have to c do that
there possibally out geting vi so the l tradition
and they don't need to ask for a mission
that's my question
what is this talk about
let me illustrate this
this is what i'm going to be
that's terrible weets of time
so that only if you pay by an hour
how' sh you be for now
that's what they work
any conscious
it doesn't find an object
can you walk around and braa yours
he just moved away
now ement was everything medicine was gone
first haveout these political parties
and they did it in the cool hash a wave
they changed the person to person
so it's more about time douring thearnday than about time during a momentry
was doing cook at
that would her fight
she learned about h ranch
75 of them are women and children
she had had support network
they we us machines the way the digital technology in match
it's almost becoming in dinetax the visual language
it it turns out the evidence takes on the once
it's a pretty simple idea right
noney of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
young people as well
let's help them behave a voice
and that's what we did
we are trism
this time the soors is not need to be signed
we hs of war
thank you very much
so they feel safe to come there
i think we were the
i have grand further
we cannot have say program
how about that
were all white
i wouldn't know
and that's hope
i'm never go to be living up about
they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments non profits after overcome myself capable of govering as
this is possible
and the reason so hard
that's what happened with my hand
they get there to move
they can see the water around
my dad is alhersisist
i'm talking to a better person
and we can't now if it looks to be like that
there was a gap
the problem where solving is what are those things
so back with me
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i oe platforms and computers they put me on the intere when i was chinner
and they couldn't work for him
what would that change about quality of life nutrition
why didn't you tell me that
what can i learn with you
that's very cool
so that was easy
and the whine cre int through the bloodstream
we want the real thing
so we need the solutions and these people play the game they are run out
so that's it for now
that's an awful 
and one end of this sense of very contract from a western company for single surveillance
and incredible
i was arifried
the same trol that united us to drop the terrors
that's also say it's impossible
growing up i was do dreaming how people get
let's justplay
i don't look that funny
that doesn't probably happen every day
now i'mjecting for my interview
i get an education
i get my up train
we must adopt their way of giving back
i'm not stories
and we try to deal with it
it's time for sl
i that would be the day
it's not one brain
and that's what i'm calling for here now
so you want to go to that point mean but you only want to pay attention to build interest
so what do we do
we almost start to feed ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
so the temp thing can work
and one of the major challenges of our process really need to find photographs that before something
what say yes
we were so excited
and grab people are warm and finding in their nghts' plan
the gam surrounded by m of sx and chars
the answer to that question is very five
we are attentes to others
it's all about what he used from that
what cev data a part of your incomotives what your values
and i said it i just sared so deeply about my customers i would never sell them more of a rapid products
i we feel about it best life says because forming question it is a really complex
let's think about you're having your footprint
but quite frankly going to there is go on the road
we have the viital education
he says that over going
do the right thing we are about ourselves i think to solve the problem
you're probably will
we have invested in the internet
most need to make money if we sit down
now don't get me wrong
of course it was
and you make that decision
that's not any problem with deep
you know about number
you didn't have any speech
you  a ba
it made me feel smart
i learned something that can't make you feel small
i don't ev know what this real job day honest
it was the goalest i've ever been
