not we repabent
started looking atferent
it's about sst
i looked at my friend ring off than for the
it's very hard to pal decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movement are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lock ourselves in the room that and we try to figure out we're about together
ll we rejected all of that
we looks like what it feels like and most of what value
especially when it comes to climatean
but in the process they allso train our brain down what somebody else do
the movement depending changed what they we crathing poverty one
were very often we think about political change de finght partm
so i want to talk to you today i think' much more recip for deeper
a couple of years ago a group of decided that we wereat the limits of what we had accomplished

that's nothing special
no choice
it had no choice
i realized of course that countries
just what thats the last thing want to do

one of them grew up
my mother was on the line tell me d anser
choices don't make sense because the wrong question
i thought we should just say home
so we sid go the m

he told me not tearly one
i think it might be a life like
that las one actual dx message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we need to be crazy like
could nothing event
i'm doing
reallyed about the way they were p that
tible difference train
supported me all the way throuing
that's something we had b

we're placed with people
deep it w
not fa
when i get out i'm go to be redect
point
we really don't want anymore
we' of to help
b
we have no sx bats
we sh came off the top of the most interested amican
i rerad the name to police department because of that
and all of this matters are crazy we're probably sav the most important function of
but when you started to look at the data by the way don't have when weook look at the data
so i decided to focus to help their most decision
at thep spectrum we doing terrible job
act
and 67cent of people back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level trre traic order from our office trat
about truma finolence
some people call the daits
and one of them said we had grabm tweks ago
and they wr them they would po up on the board
they haven't been confented of your crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensivein times they were limited local
and when i look at the criminal systm united i felt that same way of
when i tartedch i found question and i came back
we have no dispect
at that time cam lutr was the most interesting america
and when i talk to around the united states which i do all the time now they all the same
theyre the pi p down 20 years ago
he impacts everything
it worked for the old d and worked the date ofuturety
they're just waiting for their day course

i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to for that make substantial progress
weould such
don't
wealth ripped away from productive
they don't represent what sorry
we had to the battle between
i won't worry i'm i won't trust that
nothing happened at all
but that
but that'st much of problems

what makes h read
i want to be the ofent
is not worry
this is what i' s toctually be able to do
tal
thank you very much
why complete
that i thought not be a mattering
that
we wouldn't be

ump
this w
and after that enlishi prototype was the outed to make free open source offtways that others doould' have
what you have to sha
we haveh coud
that' your m
we need porable o the benefit
how should we wor
it's about as much possibly
how should be thin
to reefently moreanizing
never want to do that
take look for this
but don't know
don't have to pret w to w free
beter reaction
where is it now
