they want to be part of it
and that i wouldn't wr them about it but what would it mean about my career
i don't work
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments make them feel worse
and i don't haveter 20 f5
so i looked for furniture
why is that
what differencees may if they talk like yourure hse fail
we i want differences to make
i want to maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
likefe is good
the poins you might get me of home
it wasn't just like them to mispractice
one percent you get to do that
i didn't want to
it's not an arabic
after college that that's what needed to find a place to co home
they need the jackpot
you look at the cannd and the animal
i'm in the crucible right now
what is the abstraction
do no question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an opera all night long
that's what moves you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the wld
we are now very comfortable in imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of the antie realityv
and it's hard and its courage but that's why we're alive fri
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so n notally i asked what is deafic
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy a global malword campaign
it should be inspiring
how can youk for sure
we created a diagnied success
i am sick too much stomach
that is not simply critical toomy
and i remember we had experience with this
in other words a corder con find these things because this's a fatal recipe
what can we do with all of it
roughly 37s thosev roughly 160 yearsovisions
what do we need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me totain for myself
patriarchy is not boys and a man
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survival of all forms of sexual abuse including three
and guess what ster cone valley
i've tried engaging people
and they also kne that they could happen to the workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people try totmut ideas
and that's actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
how to getin with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what that must to feel like
when you train them however you adjust causing according to rare they are
hen wanted to say where he could stand the room or into the plan as sate prxs we could get his hands
and that's exactly what that is
you remember calllos
you need to be able to do something with it
we'ill always tung many fasi
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to theceptions
there's no more of it
so we did the analysis ag itslght a different way
we make two to three times more than anybody else
lets go back in this earth questationion
sustainability has got to be a precompetitivesue
and even if we did everybody working on we've got to beasalpatis
so what mother treat
well that's going to be breeding around pro compaction
i don't have a new of you
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not the intelligent aim in this life
just is the response
because it's given by other people
we can do it two people together try to improve t justust
you know all the same witness to that position themam
again in car
thousands of women started reaching out me to share their own stories of pain and ading as shamed
i was petrified
not a lot of canats
and when she went complaints to a major he said what
dor harass me doesn' tocriminate
they just do it
they all loove the same betre my it means to a firstppspation
well i think about this all the time
but now jeck not where they go on our treat of life
it's just not possible
it has been gress
it' happening every day
they're looking and looking and finding love
how what are you
i thin this is a problem
but the d don' b wasch it
it makes more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
i rit it i really have to mootke hern
it's not that they didn't want me think cricky
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
and a letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk
well let's hold on to that thought for just to me
it's like a piece of junkman to be thrown away
you've broken your back
that heia reallyck knowledged
these guys could be true to their purpose we was finding more th the guys
we need to be part of a community to survive
it' about equality
we all load the inside with the answer is
we've not sence we were babies
i started looking at some really carefuly
it's about sixems
i looked at my friend who drilled def try well writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make the part of very rational decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lock ourselves in the room for two days and we try to figure out we bound us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what it core values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brain to tun dou with somebody else's isissue
this mant that the movements demanding changed knew what they were against crushing poverty why
we very often we think about political change in de find apartment in day
so i want to talk to you today but what i think is a much more complete recipe for deeper
a couple of years ago a group of in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm dealing
we're not asmart of the same spaess
we part of the same family
i have resonghts so i see how they fight
and i won't game bames because don'tally war
what that is a disruption of real life important work
we've all done it
brits and degrees belo zero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the excer patient with massive choses of chemotherapy
and she suffered so much
such love and friendship and their protection
we merish
the question why did she said
which is why that ivid igy and their wal street job and it's braght sh future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love psychological trap to guys to love one
he kept one thing that loved department of our car
and here's where those cons to me
i exgraduateed from harvard college
no abuse the lighte of day by talking about it with your children your coorkers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself forhleep
i was just giving expliriation and that's my job
and all of that sounds green until you figure out where it's really going
and we were unprepared we don't forget
they're not my children
and i did not know what to say
we can build healthy of relationships around rates if we learn to calculate locates
on the other hand statistics that's the subject that you could and should you
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these lt issues
you can try it
everything new some whatere is out
and that put you my mind
how cool is that
that's nothing special
ain it had no choice
it had no choice
i realized of course that all countries are unqu
just when that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get chance to mess it up
one of themoo crawled up in rota
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctor she felt a lump and stomach themal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
i thought we should just say home
so we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that godned me
who wrote fine
i tacked along with my neighbors
i'll meet youo far
and i said to myself i want to get me one of them
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
rett it matters a lot
iaid what do you mean
he's a great gdy
so i'm not saying that saying the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your job is some challenging
the science is that
data drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated pack and tracking technology from lugic company that i work for
but we're not there again
you see there's a lot of things which just don't have say at har
with that you can actually triger e a funding before a crisis can happen
it's a wind all around
it's a commityvate for bringing data into the humanitarian worlds
and that's the big deal for profession that's denied made
and germany and friendess
surely we know enough
four times the mass of a sun
we have to get graght
you have to or it
how come we quic
there's a flip side as well
is shocking to realize that only 28 of american
and we'll not forget the day we got that text message
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not  tarly one
i think it might be a lifeline
that last ones an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build the crisis text onotline
who's that the event
i comem using it in my comforty
whatever re it is about that person where they were born things like that
here reconcciable differences right
they supported me all the way through it
that' something we had to celebrate
it's got better
we're blessed with people who listening to us
something was wrong
did not easch infaded the netherland
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm rera it out
we really don't want anymore
we'd go to help him
blocks havelips
we have no sxch patterns
we took campon off the top of the lists as the most interested in america
i ran the came to police department because of that
and all of these matters are crazy because we're probably safey something is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data which by the way if the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on new decid and analytics to help make their most critical decision
and at the op other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
he impacts saency
and 67c of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low levels drin cases on the streets just af the quarter from our office intereusted
in about trie of fiolence
some people call it dat andcience
and one of them said we had grabbery two weeks ago
and they would take a yllow city they would rit some giy and they would put it up on the morard
they haven't yet been convicced of the crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming and they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i felt the exact same way that i did about the nateive
so when i started my job at the oror foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have no suspects
now at that time came l new jersey was the most interesting in america
and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all see the same
they let the bascebus down 20 years ago
he impacts everything
it worked for the oken haand and it worked in the state of luter team
they're just waiting for their dat cors
i didn't expect that because i expected one the re
i'm definced 1ear old
and reconnected over really small things like the fact that i love cunntri mu day which is meally
this is not a fosso profille for your facebook
what about you
i was gowing three hot time as well
i don' watch
the only partys better backed up
women here caming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results we of the surprise
i don't c
wealthy it's ripped away from people who should be caught unproductive
they don't represent what c ourter views are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamerin
we won't work thomas jefferson saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not case at all
but that's as much tons of problems
so i'm in the media
do you think the government should read distributeive
and so we need to do better at copying their national environments to get them to grive
what makes the hard you need
i want to be the center of attention
why is it not worry
this is what i'm supposed to acturally be able to do
did you ya yet on min
thank you very much
why could justet businesses compette
then i thought this got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we wouldn't not beat there
that it's hard
that's theatus quo today
they need and what they need when they need it
go f just six people
this is watch to sta there forever
quiet the opess
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype was set outed to make free and open source software so that others do not have
so why do we leve to chack
who we neverage to the cloud
that's the bat
we need portable othh benefits
how should we work
it's about earning as much as you possibly can
how should be there
we need to reinvently proorganizing
i would never want to do that
take a look at for this
whom we don't know that their own researcher
you don't have to put in any waters because the washingt dring on free
so are the leadership by humediation
i said where is he now
thanks for ahking
and they're not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we are imagine
but it's not enough
i've built a corea
thank you very much
youedould bend money
we will tolerate that
but when i was litt i remember he would kill flies in our house with might beun
so to someum rise if we could offer a cob quality education to everyone around the world for free
that didn't go for really well
we can open up sital
i love mily very much
what about manipulation
so that's mobile population
i didn't want to want to so badly
we can't identify with that party
that doesn't happen to me
make it all a way up
ma gat
m getle win
thank you very much
it's not that teacher how to ride a bike
but here's the thing
i don't know
that's bad
it was a part
we can start putting entire layer of teacher information on the real world
my parents came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of contention and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
so what it was that going to
that is the ri
istin baker mthley
how old are
if i did a position made
think't active
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
i will not sx people to do that
so i changed my immedian hold 1 thou0a0 faces
what makes technology useful unusable
weill happen to turn that a st
and that obtection this project
i became psycholgic researcher and i have to voted my work to understanding that human capacity is care for others
so when the church is often is not cooar
how do they operat
why are we embedded in social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from paring for her mother
how far do they reach
mean how do they form
so we have a defectx in famiies tykers
so when you think happens to theal
we w toga when we get the engine grapin no wey can tell that they have a problem
and in fact it probably wanted
we've done the research
they're often not recognized at home
women are worthing
mre telling it's not going down it's going up
she had to impersonate mat
so thank you for your attention
they told it about home on replacement therapy
and not enough it' being done about this
i'm not sure any w
and we'd like to think thetack in i think 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was by building the goods and products and now we have the surface
you would be twingcorders from the boff
but in fact he found something very surprising
but that really isn true anymore
this is the real mest cram
it was also the first psent callmon feministe
my brother's anot' interested in h
get come over and helpy
i can change your behavior
even that was tough
some did not everybody
she wanted to change policy at the government lever
for the heath the guys
it's not in that tre
it's not an option
there not been shipped up heet
and what was the result of that
and that's quite been a pleasure speaking to you
but it's not just china
we are the fhilass ofge
weuspended our values
we have ideal for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own world
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just the rock in afghanistan
i do believe we can fix what's broken
we all want to
it got part time ice
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history that's the one we have
i didn't find a nine school
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of a geological record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers mean as good as the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagined that my kids are going to liave in a time when the most valuable compondities on fresh water
art is not efficient
that was only whenay get anything done
efficiency is for robotic
human relationships are not aition
that's thevlilable right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control of these forces
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had to stucky cover under her deadate school
but it's also an important day for another reason
but before that cooperation human realized ony was asascinated and that part of the
me i did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket science
to pick up the keys
i should have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and pulling for this object
my research team and i went to west point military kenemy
that's the work that stands before us
it's an unhunchood process
it's an automatic process
we go out there and we copy our cars and we drive th fromgh place to place
i have resources
in fact it's more like five percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
i' have the easy
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other for deep water
they were unexpected pleasures
or whateres in love
how much can we change
so when we metch ouring singnor in high school
the question for us now is how much can we make our fes
nottle one
i would be back
it's the war on con
but i love it for i don't lve
they make sense of the past
but it wasn't just individuals
what a contradationion
but it's different
it is notn' put down of anyoneay
irresponsible
it didn't want
i was brave enough to welcome it
started to walk in the community and the dcigifying scien real line that they w
they ne is important
we get l on
so they won't go for a while they won't han out with their friends they won't need
it cracks open my world
his name is laniah he is the veteran vietam
she was id closed
they want to know how much exercise your dog is tated
they want to know how often talk gets outside
are youe are you mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem di
so what happens next
i would a warn you about what youve about to go through
why are we't we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who is going to inherit his name and his forte
he also hadas 11 children
not the wisfe not the kids
it should not have been surprised
please look at me
so no more basic
aptions actually nat on the table
so it's up to high
but it was going o kasion
and this routine went are it for some time
and now i love numbers
most of my friends wouldaking japanese
it was always very small
you nothing in
so water with something thats can me a beginn with
soought one i appunish myself
and this became my only cree m my rosone
i try everything
i thought this would be great far
i'm a true song
why was it amazed
it's a fucking or che
did feel home
how is it mange
making about the other party
why don't we need to stucky this any more
what if the exact relationship between goen house daff and planetar
do we already know the consequences of the changing climateon subtd civilzations
imagine gugling a filpall across the topin
indeed we want the risk of making things worse
you're seeing the bab's brain
there were others like myself who were full time
it's the bad gught
the children were killed on this botty
it's not a dirte word
but those surveillance features come in lost
government offishs are extremely mad
i have to take cre off
i did me have my woman friends
and guess what
i don't know about
they grow crops
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity micro woman
and this is greaty
i just disagree with this
i want to go
every gives heernature
there's poicch going on
there's people everywhere
and we evolved on this planet in the contaxctt of all the other animals with which we share
and i was like oh that was on
and i'm sure the fingers are similar other hundreds
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
the rituals was rebiliou
how could i come from the nation
what kind of resuce are these
one million people
but the magnitude the problem is something we need to appreciate it
i know what it works
but i'm not happy
n was my dctor
even nghtight w an0 mes
you might get a peace back
it's a lot starting
i want to know how they impact me
i want to know how i compack them
lots of money
just waight
it's a top creditor
i'm noting to be so helpy
support local economies
i made more money
we've seen an image of our blue plant our world bank
got lovegh waywork
we don't even neim that much time to do amazing things
now wh she had to find seven hours because therereid water all over her basement she found
what are you chird
so how do we do that
you say you're wory more than 60 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in the day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working a way more than full time couars
how else do we greate new ideas
china is the world traat a sanding pofety program over the last few decades
i but some of our grandchildren probably will
its natural connected tissue
can we release scale to something
then they had to bring them in
but you know what the acts with facts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't right
without it me ler really can't interfaced with others
my desire had disappining was still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the values in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find the way to globalize the pulps or to
we an act little
and we callght the answer
they were arguing weould one another about access on sit
simplem coins fall a way down from what it used to be
we can create a global parliament of pays
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity and adition of new potential for innovation for development
but the questions who will have us
there will be invisible cpacenity
of course migration will become even more important
and thisse change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first people have the children
because we have stem cells
when i was de1 i didn't realize i was bazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child develop aartitism
that was the power of you
when you get
it's actually not that hard
we lachst valuable datas
that was a huge problem at the eing earthquake
it's about the kada
i'm not strong enough to lift be carried on back from the graans to the car seella
i mean you couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing is growesidt
going
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformation climate transmition we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw event downa one
that's sort of the state of the arten
and now we want to do a double double of the ageway of coming through
and so they took them to some safe place
h understand how this could happen
in fact what should happen to my brain
we now have a platform
and my own world didnt become
i us this that better thing
i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
well we bought one of these
gamb on men
but there's actually more to the stories than that
the oil will never put out
what's different is how molecules are put together
effectively the darabolety a complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them fa
if any child is found viinating the tools need is severely reprimandet
then even fatter
i'm not be sy 
one was the pig soldier
they sign it because they want some form of for a fenish
the other one to be a pizceball player
but if they don't stay in parents the international pressures will be overwhelming
it pret good
we have the plan
i am thinking of the rgh for me
penrce through my body with the filce of my lung view
i am torking you by you love for me
but remember what i said my love
and i did i don't know
i remember when you said to me
we might say that well let's not worry about this
that means at some point it's going to meet new problem to you
how doid it happen
it was like a star ip
that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
we can create a dec centralized database that has the same efficiency of monopollyies
we can see everything wikipedia
it's a compositive view that's constantly changing being updated
and how is that possible
nohm wrongonouk we don't have comedymins
they have bad ideas
then she gets the bosses to rate how creative innovative are
i'm the opposite
so people care about this study and they're like great if i w to get better my job i just ended upgrading my present
they know you can fail by startingpuscos bankrupt or my feliling can started business at all
because each year the winnter has come from a different cribial group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i ne churse to me lcture
and this wasn't just in i was trcking question
i couldn't care myself away from the coverage
african americans supported it at a higher level that had ever been recorded
and others resented this comparison between g rights civil rights and
we're looking for something more
i do like magic
but you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clean
that mayght always be the case
we can change our own minds
they're completely flatct and they're missingally cardboard characters
i got about 3000 miles
mic website
soin then i've been a picture a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much pretentional
it is about proving who you are and which can do
brought in the other men
i went back home and i said dad and i don't know who i am
and is the school
no one toland had any idea that anything gone wrong
you bored the plane
the engine fails
the plane takes off
they dreamed up a variety of horrified scenarios
there were no bad jors
how do you get to build those relationships
you've just had a new thing sometimes
so we created a new cour
and boor they were like one
but that doesn't mean that we can
now that's a very dood point
what would wrong
we have to decign what it means
but this is what i lood from a lot of how rich people
the answer was no
this is now stuff is made memorable
and i got pretty into it
you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous fis sculpture
now i know why i'm here
well guess what
for depression it was fool and a half times
what kind of crmam i talk about here
for hpatitis it was also two and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
well imagine youre walking on the floorst and you see apit
and that's prettymazing
but eventually they didn't come around
you are here a so luge village
and so it was perfect for something like that
we need to sleep beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
they're not soill neated
and uses what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
there's no of weight
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so whh women's experience as it relates to mentoring
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis is getting worse day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters of a new productor service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
ok we can make a mobile guy your cetter
we didn't have volunteers
we drive around
thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of them
imagine if we had across the country right now in local plac h bean
i have passionate in my heart
it's just a war
both of them braing imaginations in life and what is it remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and use something
well not yet
as the whole neern movement
look at this pretty structure
their faces broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will paint dividance
and in many cass we don't
but we are cood
d replies so often you won't even notice it
that wasn't the case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no war chargeed before you
and then something falls off the walk
i can cur the way
only onec of the people are actually farmers
sot to find me
so what can we do
who cares about posni
they don't get their money out
sing my child
she works in the bak
