and for me the surprise was
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next day
and there isn't much else than that
the se7 half of october
well in to know them
we can just about to get away with it now
something like a garden compost
not all aboutu
and if you're w wonderful
starting with a complex
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
please don it now
don't forget me
these are my words
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the blue thingce
he we was so popular
instead of being someone's arm cenndei
i expect you to have the past
see how much it comes to
i paay the money
over the cause of his life
when it's finished
but before i doid
this house will just come together and flourish
any man will be proud to have view as a son
at the end of the diet
get them into the garden
this one is totally out of control
but it comes and goes
it's part of that for garden schin
i think it's brilliant
a one bedroomed first roall flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm not massively happy
if you are looking around auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what a surprise when you come in
because if it's fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not as easy as it looks
stick to what you're good at
that is important
but he did really well
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
i couldn't read it
except as a last resort
you never know by the end of the bild
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some member of the publics don't quite understand lishold
if you lived in the building
would you want e neighbour every week or every fortnight
but i think he's already learnt some really important property lessons
choosing the good location
you have to hold your nerb
who's very much into family history
we don't want to spend more than
if certainly won't be
i think something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm writing baying that
time hadas passed
so let's go back and find out
i'm very impressed
the best bargains
not quite as vike
it's a plus point
on the face of this
the first and second four flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give it a try
go to the press
learning the rps
h feet tall
and the readon for that
a little sax approach
whatever you are
it may be a miniature compared to that
i can plant them in that s spot
sometimes he doesn't
i think it looks great
that's quite a large leaf
and it's a great way to eat it
that first mechion
but now we have these viruses
thrupot firus
causes it no harm
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is the town of two cities
it's a long way from home
and you enter the raar part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm still happy
you must have a personal keith
we will own it together
it will be a great investment
or properties should i say
put it on the outside
because it was offices
very close by the university
ground flor flat
i would market that
as another ten on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartments around here at the moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
realistic value wise
she was a floodship
even befo she entered the water
vigiting almost all parts of the empire
from small ships
is it true she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you intend to bid on the place
it's hard to come away from it
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroying the property
purely by chance
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
who is my builder
we're pa in a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic foot villain
and then of course
desperate to prove your bizarre theories
but since jack's first discoverevery
protected from the prevailing wing
searching for answers
we know what they are
there's no obvious reason
taking horticulture to the extrets
the whole gardens are extraordinary and
like hundreds of thousands of people do every year
but now there's more protection
about 20 years ago
and a couple of weeks ago
enjoy the summer
are they relativeves to yours
not just a hotel
but the ward offic story
people would be able to go back
not just a hotel
not just in this time
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his vartage point
there is no air so there is no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new build property should mean you don't have any work to do
some issues with potential damp
great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so mrgeren is relying on this information
all the brain is combining all the different senses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
what have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open plant area is definitely the way to go
travel three miles furth the w and you do get more for your money here
if that was fitted out
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be a above path
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
things like that we'll do ourselves
this auction lot has it in spain
if you can't go up
it cosmetically improved quite drastically here
on the second floor
it's very clean
the appliances have been done nicely
could be your passport for a small fortune
another words made the base
garage and techno funk
no novever mum
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spring
over the last few weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel the world
here in this greenhouse and the other one
as long as your calm
is it all good news
why are many supermarkets stopping selling caved eggs
three range goods
to make it work
very few remains
taking it all in
one northern welsh rulerft
for the first time
formerally acknowledged his title to depreat of wales
and here on top of the eagle power
it just now in syvria
according to legend
it was a briank canvas
for the first you weill know
as she lay dying
the garrison responded with a ha of arrows
and when you're moving through enemy territory
the garrison tried to surrender before he could try out his new toy
he ordered them back inside
you don't deserve migrraates
taking no chances
tearing it to the ground
according to legend
there was a port colours
did the sun on the stairs
which is ideal for it
cracks will appear
someone came out of a neighbouring property and sas
very expensive shedf
without my sun gas
even the foreplace
and then when it came to his signature
it's a backing show
she's pushed herself
it sounds wrong
what if we learned
children and adults are like
that's a shocking percentage
i'm just hopeful
we have a lot less atmosphere above us
no longer would measurement be based on the human body
no longer dependent on the sun
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks for watching
our continued pressure
an inflamouory photograph
in flammory or terrible images
we have to look at how faudi arabia
in terms of britain
to the average persent
there's a fair chance you will be
about 2 million
when it comes to the issue of people marriage
to allow bad surveillance to withher on the vine
if you don't like to flowis
you have a problem with it
in all seriousness
but it has established the infrastructure of a police state and it could be open to abuse in the
i had nothing to hide
feher street lighting can help
the next generation
i'm not jeremy vyine
standing in for your regular host for one week on leaf
and what a privilege that is
if you're watching
that's all for this week
don't you agree
across 95 miles
floating hotels
but before that
i can't believe it
in the form of a dessert plate
regarding one of britain's most noted
that makes a grand total of six
in a modern house
without first revief
the perfect pipe
anything could happen
they're all about the same
we have run out of time
ree and kevin
now they are gathering
all light in the arctic
could we arrange that
i was fine yesterday
let's not mess about
what i can tell you
this is south wealth
the romans felt their presence was strong enough here
p say to the king
when he was staying at the palace
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
literally two minutes from the airport
maybe more of steill and i
which melts more ice
think about the melting sea ice
again open to the elements
very attractive young woman
and that has an important effect
provided by the railways
the great thing about the railways is
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
there is one thing
it might be bom finite
of course it was
today's contestants of
thanks for watching
i feel guilty when i'm at home
i will always need you
thank you very much
as you might say
but myk goodness
also known as a tndam
so i think it is a piece of very one dimensional left wing propaganda
there was a huge cross over the thinging the two
tax credits are basically benefits
formerly knowamn as simon
i feel like that
because that's how you are a parth of society
before i came out
or more correctly councfuls
especially as it relatees to children
if they are children
i do hope youll join us then
thislam allows to living me
if you haven't caught it yet
myself currently learning to find
some people here tonight re fir upbsitcles
surely as a matter of principle
if you're watching
stand a great surprise
head of timide blow
in the meantime
when my husband and i are not around
asking for permission
and it was totally normal
that sounds like a pretty cravy job for anyone to be doing
all my fingers wereth hanging off
i went to lave my right arm
he was shot and killed
if i didn't have her
but at the same time
i'm with mark twain lies
it's the internet
and i'm wn
in the basement
they haven't gone father
time now for one of the greatest tv combacks of our time
harold in neighbours
we need to start layering
won the pilot
surrender was not an option
many were teenagers about to get their first taste of wath
i soly sorry
he died that very first day
this is one of the questions
celebrating 100 years of war film
where i'm going
but ten years ago
it could end tonight
back in pierra leone
and this wasn't unusual
as well as the bodies
giving hope and care to others is something our armed forcies do without questions
we heard the story of the nurse and a ccross
to have no conceact with w
she needs to make sure that
they don't call them team pocket rocket for nothing
you've probably got yours
and the weather has been perfect
courage under fire
most of his life
this is the lord ashcroft gallery
trapped under heavy artillery fires
ten days beforehand
the pregidant elet has net with peregdant obama
mr fan takes office in january
today they talked about the process of transitions
we have all the usual suspects
anywhere in the world
demonstrates the value of green space
sort of ten cubic metres
i just collapse
as we approached for remembrance sunday
i've been involved with the military
the armed h forces
that knock on the door is the moment they will never forget
who was killed in afghanistan
on a routine visit to an iraqi police station
killing him and five friends
won't take them moment
so what is the etiquette
which is a shamed
between them now
i have had my fising now
mr kh' speaking

i don't really want to go
prising abo it
the olympics swimmer
i wish i was more like you

a tribal nation
which upset some of our female resvidence
thanks for watching

it was really nice
you won't have long
on this remembrance weekend
an opportunity to paytribute to all members of the armed forces
if you've got it
we would love to sell it
we would love to see you
only seven places remained
like many others
great lenonard coen
i love weddings
i've got a better idea
why don't we alloo deat
that was amazing
it was an incredible performance
it was incredible entertainment
up until last week
the man takes the leav
it's time now for everything in between
i really appreciate it
is all based on this 58 pge report prepared to the european commission
but when you looking inside
they get mosque on the way home
and you've got every right to be
having said that
that was fast and furious
dum and dusty
that's not an ancient roman mask
these japanese made
which a lot of them were
our journey even know yet
and it's not just any tuesday it
who knew that one man
but it might be too late
don't think so
from what we know
thank you very much
graham barrn ash
and they were the first peopleup
earlier this month
it was brilliant
furniture objects like that
it was made in germany
no one would look twe
and i'm pretty sure his pushbike came in very handy
they were so inspired by it
check the details on our website
known as much a profit
keep going on about this
i do nothing wrong
you sen what do you think
this is where the surprise is happened
it's time to return to wolthver hampon
they decided to tie the knot
everywhere you go around here
we have some unfinished business to do in the auction room
we have gone difficult
and after reaching out for him on the show
run for cover if you can
they are under a lot of stress
with that in mind
welcome to the tower
was it your choice
you really feel apart of it
it so wonderful to see that
talking about this
for me it doesn't make sase
if we have a belief in re incarnations
even though her father at that time disagreines
so when the body have brought back
my first glannd dose up
nonviolent offensive
there are a lots of people
around the world
but i can across training prisons
so whatoo it at the cost of the failour
and the average cost a keeping the first inpent is 36
the most famous of them all have to be the works of the bronte sisters
in terms of fire service resources
rather than using drugs
that's good news
the big question is
have you ordered yours yf
but these are one of the most wary birds in the world
that's not what i was expecting at all
i lo syib with
and you know what this means
we might find some maritime memorabilia
it's a wonderful
stocks and shares
and in the process of me not offending god
i don't care what the cost is
because the whole point of 9 11 is that it's the justification for the police state
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've heard
and it's all about the contx
charldoo for millennium
two appointments later
the man cares about animals
guess what i'm talking about right now
here to give us a rundown of the greatest facial chorreer w' be ever seen on the fox

on international women's day
and went an ordinary wing
the duke of bloucester
and you know that
we have the delectable neil jones
but don't worry
that was some time ago
real friends that care about me
clearly they do
you don't need it
the reason being
the president chair
not to think for themselves
that is a first
with my blessing
that's the message from independent economists after the channcellors autumn statements
and with that in mind
his father die
not just here in nottingamshire
but it seems de teendence to everyone's personal teach
it's time to find out if idgel
remember that man with the camera
and you can follow us
thanks for watching
it's not all thatangs
i do know what it means
when i found out
after all i've been through
i want to talk about daddy too
everybody was blown away
we still have all of it to come
i want to take a selfie
rescuing a damzol in distress
all of that to change
but what exactly is it
how does it work
there's always historical treasures to look at
far and furious
and later in turn
later in life
she moved around a lot
as it's the title of this poem
four kilometres without even re thinking about it
in the highway code itself
so in the meantime
through antibody elected therapy
and i feel very
i'm your simon cowll
for some reason
i just can't seem to win
it would be a brilliant success
who retreat the flag
i'm struggling with that one
here's a latin sensation
born into a family of dancers
i made a few calls
as well as the green man
this is extremely rare and valuable
not the subject matters
my hasen to edd
here on the day
but i felt he was exposed
and you and him
will appear in court next month
and the champagne
before we bring on our next contender
if you've got a question for either of them
so to do ballroom
i am the ultimate power
it is the quarter finals
we had a blazing
when he retired
the family seat
please welcome jenniy aclaire
it's a movie theme
they have no idea to expect
two and a half minutes for that round
so let's get on with it
thanks for watching
i'm not satisfied
it's on our table package
when we see him
want me to be happy
what season was that
nont boolle ourselves
on me to a passion
probably in the world
i'm really looking forward to this
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dugg into by antiplarians
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand one of these minuments in a modern
and people live in
it's about the tase
a purification so many
it's so much an old perse
and this might think
every single prej of
that's the best kind of teaching
i had a great time
that's what child ofport services does
nicola is definitely the love of my life
sh is my juliet
with the shelter my marin
i guess i'm afraid
i like spending time with him
and it is a service
she's got to the best top line in the business
so i don't know
that's what you said
it is just a name
i've been worked
talk about about smart
my little boy is
that seems to me like a pretty impressive perf of the job by anybody's standards
we bought the firm back
enjoy the money
embossed leather wallpaper
i'm getting older
i'll be popping ina ch eving
join me tomorrow
but she's not confused
you need to be stronger here
make sure you never get the psed again
we billly not be in yours
when it comes to designing fabulous prostues
their bufflings be crowned pro challengeed champions
the prime minister snappsomim down
heopping it did that
separated from that
coming in on the other side
what did you put in the mib wine
it's a terrible idea
and they don't make big money
everywhere you look
you really make my daye
and we have today
men will to be him
he absolutely insisted on writing his own intro
family and friends
it's all about the strictly for challenge
but before we can go any further
the six highest scoring runners up will qualify
thanks for watching
just before christmas
that's it for the reds
i think she's completely bonkerous
you are dynamic
it was full of content
adlen w was saying
it's actually a salsa
the garden of england
you can get a better structure
every year since christmas began
way back in the early
i actually wanted to be a horse
usually impicible
through the accessibility to those children
like most other forms of modern warfare
you do love your dog
they were innocent and charming
you want to look
or is that you enjoy those toys and it makes youem into afferent person
space was still the final frontier
it looks really like it is
when i get home
the ball shaped one
you see that present
for what he did to get round ba
but in those days
it comes a fire engine
all little turtles named after italian renaissance artist
some burned brightly for a year or two
if he didn't have one
what was all that about
already in the states
the right place
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
sausages in bicon
christmas pudding that nobody really likes
stick some james bond on
that someone was going to get
she can't really say
ot in front of the whole family
you unpolled the board
at the same time
in victorian britain
on the orders of queen victoria
i think he is perfect
when it comes to toys
maybe not uranium
but i like see it
we like to rem a ne
for that reason
this really makes us think
maybe there's an expensive pattern
when the arthiog just got to work
i tried not to get carried away
it really was that bad
but they will not do
let's take a look behind the themcenes how it all came
time out for our next guest
over the last 12 years
why show me this
and'm on the case
even christmas dath
but towards the end
he has not held back anything
but it was so disconcertinly calm in the studio
here to reveal the secret to getting your hands on your trophy
i shouldn't say those things
what else can i be
not well dressed
she is married now
best than happiest of all
the time before him was his own
that's where i am
it sounds very good
she's depressed about daddy
have you listened to me
i'm still surrounded by hundreds of people
all the information will be there
hevery week comes out
the rivorry in all wack
leave that to me
but fool that
i'd like to help you
i don't want to resign
which is incredible
i had no idea how much
but at the same time
so let's find out who that will beat
some recent scores
thanks for watching
the perfect house
the perfect family
and as a result
the first muslim woman to serve the catholic minister
it's not the middle ages
he doesn't own m me
for please welcome
it was actually the extremely well placed
lease don't have a vote if you're watching on tomark
attention and emotion
and it is perfect for tonight
can they improve on that score and possibly run away with a trophy
that was within fightet
for the audience at home
the rite of mader
proper street food is great
you don't have to be a celebrity
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
if you can have sex
take us for the match
it's not ci
thanks for watching
fame and fortune
i'm not afraid of being challenged
there's no wrong way
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
in this case a flower
as animals are preparing for the winter
but there's a problem
cheap and steal from one another to get themselves a decentill
it seemed to be
i do miss a little bit
this is all you
before you know it
youd go to bed with it
and your family and your cave and your other jobs
that was amazing
the long you day in
because you work so hard
if you go wrong
go about selling in that
for good reasons and bad reasons
if they start from here
pobsessed with the show
i had my way
if we have a little at argument
so when he gets grumpys like
let's s for example
i'm sure you can imagine
she is in sericus
when i was a kid
very high level
goring all over the world
people are happy to be there and it's a good bd
every way you turn
because they've got to
just working with him every week it' such a treat
which was quite amusing
that's a pickle walnut
you notant to go and buy thiscits
you wast your time
they all came and went
it didn't survive
so you could be
right on the front
with thisis country
twice to the first world war
he never let on
so you know who he really is
so please welcome
this could be a first pluss routine
everyone on the show really
with white christmas
being on my own
but i can't imagine why
because i just want to help
and that face that
budgect management is really my specialist area
to be completely honest
the sheer size and power can be intimidating
but there was even better news
representif by this funch of bananas
it's down to ouri brain getting things wrong
he was about to find out
the forces of nature separes outs
neutrons and electrons
but when you open the box
that's not right
in this universe
and it might seem ridiculous
12 miles in diameter
stretching back 3
staggering on the edgees of space
pondering the immensea
we live in a tiny
thanks for watching
do you think i do this
it's all about rarity
as opposse to chinge is
but i couldn't beleve you'ould be ce
and you've got a good story
and a man who made the discover
that everyone goes into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellious socks
for get that scared
maybe to some of a nice and safe
i'm not sure what's most of all things get like
garden's never finished
she never been put off
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify rolls
there are times i like to listen to banaddar ama
and yet vatt and fish and chips
let's justlm down
today just got weirder and weirder
back to the history books
it's practically a vegetarian
how does the plant attract the bat
the bat benefits
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertisement which says
this is the best fat hotel in town
that's why i get up in the morning
two minutes on general knowledge
born in the glair of the spotlight
so what did you do before
but you have to go
and she will interviewed b the american journalists sh
we alsoersness
we did a different version of things
and then turned to you and said
i haven't thought that
that would be fantastic
so budgegum bro bent
every two weeks
that's what they do
before we begin
and on this pateful evening
what's your name
i don't believe in fairies
then we must rescue her
and with still
he made a movei on meat
we'veen discususted it
and we rll love
how do i choose this
we've got 24 characters
following those words
i think you deserve
for striking contrast
very similar to fishing
he's like looking at art
it might be conceptual
thanks for watching
here's mydeas
a place which is hard to live
and the farmers open ata
so when the farmersas come
there's no woodland
don't tell anyone
we have no mored man
we are the criminals
no more seuaside bumbers
that is according to the police watchdog
the queenary and queen elizabeth
it's designing values
they were in the minority
500 tons of ocean liner
one of the articles here is about the queen elizabeth
the job but done
thanks for watching
flowers and evy estables
to something completely different
when it comes to publicity
how great is it
i just love that
they were friends
tell me that's it
until next time
to be a successful entrepreneur
i just don't get it
and i think this is one
something like that
with corrupt governments
because of was a small size
it wll been more matches
and more money the feata
pleased with himself
serviet is panemonium let loose
there are no recordings of lloyd george at the peak of his palers
which was the mass newspaper
and he wanted very devoted to his children
and would eventually marry her after his wife
with that flourish
what you need to do is get the very best frinds
the very best talents
the most energetic people in
because the empire
it's oten forgden
which is absolutely understandable
you hope to return to power
would not be a happy place
depended on trade
my great great grandfather
much more driven
if it gives me some sort of control
the sun wins
i cann' remember that happen before
buy some miracle
that's very good
comes from one of the most usautiful parts of the world
it's not a massive sum of money
they love architecture
lighting or wrongly
i wouldn't say i'm star
1 fs
thanks for watching
set up by the government
it was a brutal experience
many people do sliking for and very delay
they kept cleaing
and in the morning
it'vea detail
and the second generation
been intensely sad
and all the survived of the holocaust
with their database
get a new loyal customer and devonanon's
as long as they see the spark of successll
with a storm circle here
during the summer months
that is a sold sound
there's plenty to indulge in
she was struggling
when he went to look for her
whenever it was
25 years to complete
she will be very pleased
because there was no role model
one male official commented
but despite all this
they carried on competing
but despite all this
if you want to experience some of that
you're wasting your time
including a brady
