and for me the surprise was
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next day
when there isn't much else than that
the second half of october
welling to knowve themb
we can just about to get away with it now
something like a garden compost
it's not all about science
and if you want wonderful
starting with a compost
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
please doron it now
don't forget me
these are my words
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the blueprint
he was so popular
instead of being someone's arm ctei
i expected you to have a past
see how much it comes to
i pa the money
over the cause of his life
when it's finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any man would be proud to have view as a son
at the end of the die
get them into the garden
this one is totally out of control
but it comes and goes
it's part of the ational gardenchen
i think it's brilliant
a one bedroomed first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm not massively happy
if you are looking around auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what a surprise when you come in
because if it's fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not as easy as it looks
stick to what you're good at
that is important
but he did really well
and do what i used to do when was a little boy
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas's
i couldn't read it
except as a last resort
you never know by the end of the billld
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some members of the public don't quite understand leisehold
if you lived in the building
would you want neighbours every week or every fortnight
but i think he's already learnted some really important property lessons
choosing a good location
you have to hold your nerve
who's very much into family history
we don't want to spend more than
it definitely won't be
i think something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm right in baying that
time has passed
so let's go back and find out
very impressed
for best bargains
not quite as high
it's a plus point
on the face of it
the first and second floor flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give it a try
go to the press
learding the rops
eigh feet tall
and the reason for that
a little sax approach
wherever you are
it may be a miniature compared to that
i can plant them in that spot
sometimes it doesn't
i think it looks great
that's quite a large lea
and it's a great way to eat it
that first meeting
but now we have these viruses
squirrel popx vius
causes it no harm
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is a town of two cities
it's a long way from home
as you enter the rear part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm still happy
you must have a personal key
we will own it together
it will be a great investment
or properties should i say
put it on the outside
because it was offices
very close by the university
ground floor flat
i would market that
asd another ten on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartments around here at the moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
realistic value wise
she was a floodship
even before she entered the water
visigiting almost all parts of the empire
from small ships
is it true she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you intend to bid on the place
it's hard to come away from it
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroying the property
purely by chancees
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
he is my builder
we pa in a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic foot villain
and then of course
desperate to prove your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the prevailing winds
searching for ananwes
we know what they are
there's no obvious reason
taking horticulture to the extreme
the whole gardens are extraordinary and
like hundreds of thousands of people do every year
but now there's more protection
about 20 years ago
a couple of weeks ago
enjoy the summer
are they relatives of yours
not just a hotel
but the ward offic story
they would be able to go back
not just a hotel
not just a liftwn
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his vantage point
there is no aere so there is no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new buld property should mean you don't have any work to do
some issues with potential damp
great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just relying on this information
all of the brains combining all the different senses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and the
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open plant area is definitely the way to go
travel three miles furth the west and you do get more for your money here
if that was fitted out
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be a above path
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
things like that we'll do ourselves
this auction lot has it in spain
if you can't go up
it's cosmetically improved quite drastically here
on the second floor
it's very clean
the appliances have been done nicely
it could be your passport to a small fortune
another words made the base
garage and techno funk
not no themm mum
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spring
over the last two weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel the world
here in this greenhouse and the other one
as long as your canalm
is it all good news
why are many supermarkets stopping selling caged eggs
free range goods
to make it work
very few remains
taking it all in
one northern welsh rw lft
for the first times
formerally acknowledged his title to the prince of wales
and here on top of the eagle tower
which is now in svia
according to legend
it was a blank canvas
for the first year liowed
as she lay dying
the garrison responded with a ha of arrows
and when you're moving through enemy territory
the garrison tried to surrender before he could try out his new toy
he ordered them back inside
you don't deserve my grace
taking no chances
tearing it to the ground
according to legends
there was a port colours
peoplere sun on the stairs
which is ideal for it
cracks will appear
someone came out of a neighbouring property and said
very expensive shed
without my sun's gassi
even the fourplank
and then when it came to his signature
it's a baking show
she's pushed herself
it sounds wrong
what have he learned
children and adults are ali
that's a shocking percentage
i'm just hopeful
we have a lot less atmosphere above us
no longer would measurement be based on the human body
no longer dependent on the sun
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks for watching
our continued pressure
an inflammatory photograph
inflammatory or terrible images
we have to look at how vaui arabia
in terms of britain
to the average person
there's a fair chance you will be
about 2 billion
when it comes to the issue of people marriage
to allow bad surveillance to withher on the vine
if you don't likeat your slogan
you have a problem with it
in all seriousness
but it has established the infrastructure of a police state and it could be open to abuse in the
i have nothing to hide
better street lighting can help
the next generation
i'm not jeremy vyine
standing in for your regular host for one weeke only
and what a privilege that is
if you're watching
that's all for this week
don't you agree
across 95 miles
they're floating hotels
but before that
i can't believe it
in the form of a dessert plate
regarding one of britain's most noted
that makes a grand total of six
in a modern house
without further redo
the perfect pinpt
anything could happen
they're all about the same
we have run out of time
louie and kevins
now they are gathering
all night in the arctic
could we arrange that
i was fine yesterday
let's not mess about
what i can tell you
this is south wealth
the romans felt their presence was strong enough here
to say to the king
when he was staying at the palace
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
literally two minutes from the airport
maybe more of steel and ir
which melts more ice
think about the melting sea ice
again open to the elements
very attractive young woman
and that had an important effect
provided by the railways
the great thing about the railways is
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
there is one thinged
it might be bonb funnight
of course it will
today's contestants are
thanks for watching
i feel guilty when i'm at home
i will always need you
thank you very much
as you might say
but myk goodness
also known as the tgham
so i think it is a piece of very one dimensional left wing propaganda
there was a huge cross over between the two
tax credits are basically benefits
formerly known as simon
i feel like this
because that's how you are a part of society
before i came out
or more correctly council
especially as it relates to children
they are children
i do hope you'll join us then
islam allows polyvany
if you haven't caught it yet
myerself currently learning to find
some people here tonight refer upbtitles
surely as a matter of principle
if you're watching
standard great surpprise
pad of time flown
in the meantime
when my husband and i are not arouow
asking for permission
and it was totally normal
that sounds like a pretty crazy job for anyone to be doing
all my fingers were hanging off
i went to lve my right arm
he was shot and killed
if i didn't have her
but at the same time
i'm with mark twain lies
it's the internet
and i'm warn you
in the basement
they haven't gone father
time now for one of the greatest tv comomebacks of our time
harolds and neighbours
we need to start layering
won the pilot
surrender was not an option
many were teenagers about to get their first taste of war
i'm tooly sorry
he died that very first day
this is one of the questions
celebrating 100 years of war films
where i'm going
but ten years ago
it could end tonight
back in pierra leone
and this wasn't unusual
as well as the body
giving hope and care to others is something our armed forcies do without question
we heard the story of the nurse and a cross
to have no contact at all
she needs to make sure that
they don't call them team pocket rocket for nothing
you've probably got yours
and the weather has been perfect
courage under fire
most of his life
this is the lord ash croft gallery
trapped under heavy artillery vironent
ten days beforehand
the president elek haas met with pregnant obama
mr trump takes office in january
today they talked about the process of transitions
we have all the usual suspects
anywhere in the world
demonstrates the value of green space
sort of ten cubic metres
i just collapse
as we approached for remembrance sunday
i've been involved with the military
the armed forces
that kn ofck on the door is the moment they will never forget
who was killed in afghanistan
on a routine visit to an iraqi police station
killing him and five friends
it won't take a moment
so what is the etiquette
which is a shame
between them now
i have had my fitting now
mr kh'm speaking
if we have learn one thing over the last year
i don't really want to go
prising above it
the olympics swimmer
i wish i was more like you
why don't we all just get along
a trival nation
which upset some of our female residens
thanks for watching
for a recon style
it was really nice
you won't have long
on this remembrance weekend
an opportunity to pay tribute to all members of the armed forces
if you've got it
we would love to sell it
we would love to see you
only seven places remained
like many others
great lenonardohen
i love weddings
i've got a better idea
why don't we all object
that was amazing
it was an incredible performance
it was incredible entertainment
up until last week
the man takes the lead
it's time now for everything in between
i really appreciate it
is all based on this 58 page report prepared for the european commission
but when you look inside
they get most on their way home
and you've got every right to be
having said that
that was fast and furious
dum and dusty
that's not an ancient roman mark
these japanese made
which a lot of them were
our journeyen over yet
and it's not just any on tuesday it
who knew that one man
it might be too late for that
don't think so
from what we know
thank you very much
graham barn ash
and they were the first people
earlier this month
it was brilliant
furniture objects like that
it was made in germany
no one would look twice
and i'm pretty sure his push bike came in very handy
they were so inspired by it
check the details on our website
known as much as possible
keep going on about this
i do nothing wrong
they said what do you think
this is where the surprise is happen
it's time to return to wthampton
they decided to tie the knot
everywhere you go around here
we have some unfinished business to do in the auction room
we have gone diigfficult
and after reaching out to him on the show
run for cover if you can
they are under a lot of stress
with that in mind
welcome to the tower
was it your choice
you really feel a part of it
so wonderful to see that
talking about this
for me it doesn't make sense
if we have a belief in reinternation
even though her father at that time disagreed
so when the body is brought back
my first granddoghter
nonviolent offenses
there are a lots of people
around the world
but i come across training prisons
look at the cost of the failure
the average cost of keeping the person in prison is 36
the most famous of them all h to be the works of the bronte sisters
in terms of fire service resources
rather than using drugs
that's good news
the big question is
have you ordered yours yet
but bees are one of the most wary birds in the world
that's not what i was expecting at all
i love sediables
and you know what this means
we might find some maritime memorabilia
it's a wonderful
stocks and shares
and in the process of me not offending god
i don't care what the cost is
because the whole point of 9 11 is that it's the justification for the police state
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've heard
and it is all about the content
childood from millennium
tw appointments later
the man cares about animals
guess what i'm talking about right now
here to give us a rundown of the greatest facial choreography ever seen on the box
things to really tell the story
get yourself over here because first up tonight
if you want to know what the kids are listening to these days
louise and kevins
and it's the one that
that was beautiful
on international women's day
and went on the ordinary wing
the duke of gloucester
when you know that
we had the delectable neil jones
but don't worry
that was some time ago
real friends that care about me
clearly they do
you don't need it
the reason being
the president chair
not to think for themselves
that is a first
with my blessing
that's the message from independent economists after the chancellor' autumn statements
and with that in mind
his father died
not just here in nottinghshire
but it seems dependent as to everyone's personal taste
it's time to find out if nidgel
remember that man with the camera
and you can follow us
thanks for watching
but it's not all bgans
i do know what it means
when i found out
after all i've been through
i want to talk about daddy too
everybody was blown away
we still have all of this to come
i want to take a selfie
rescuing a dam fuol in distress
all of that could change
but what exactly is it
how does it work
there's always historical treasures to look at
fast and furious
and later in turn
later in life
he moved around a lot
as it's the title of this poem
four kilometres without even really thinking about it
in the highway code itself
so in the meantime
through antibody directed therapy
and i feel very
i'm your simon howell
for some reason
i just can't seem to win
it wll be a brilliant success
who retreated the flag
i'm struggling with that one
here's a latin sensation
born into a family of dancers
i made a few calls
as well as the green man
this is extremely rare and valuable
not the subject matter
i hasen to ed
here on the day
but i felt he was exposed
you and him
will appear in court next month
and the champagne
before we bring on our next contender
if you've got a question for either of them
so to do ballroom
i am the ultimate power
it is the quarter finals
we had a bealaze r
when he retired
the family seat
please welcome jenniy aclaire
it's a movie seene
they have no idea what to expect
two and a half minutes for that round
so let's get on with it
thanks for watching
i'm not satisfied
it's on our cable package
when we see him
you want me to be happy
what season was that
no food luck sous
i me you a party
probably in the world
i'm really looking forward to this
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiquarians
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand one of these monuments in a modern
and people live in
it's about the day
a purification soeremany
it's almost an old person
and this might think
every single presd
that's the best kind of teaching
i had a great time
that's what child aport services does
nicola is definitely the love of my life
thish is my juiet
there was shelter my marvin
i guess i'm afraid
i like spending time with him
and it is a service
she's got the best top line in the business
so i don't know
that's what you said
it is just a name
ive been watched
talk a bit smart
my little boy is
that seems to me like a pretty impressive perk of the job by anybody's standards
we bought the firm back
enjoy the money
embossed leather wallpaper
i'm getting older
i'll be popping in each evening
join me tomorrow
but she's not confused
you need to be stronger here
make sure you never get a press again
with billing not be in yours
when it comes to designing fabulous costumes
they are battling to be groundned pro challengeed champions
the prime minister snapps him down
how big is that
separated from that
coming in on the other side
what did you put in the muld wine
it's a terrible idea
and they don't make big money
everywhere you look
you really made my day
and we have today
men want to be him
he absolutely insisted on writing his own intro
family and friends
it's all about the strictly prot challenge
but before we can go any further
the six highest scoring runners up will qualify
thanks for watching
just before christmas
that's it for the reds
i think she's completely bonkers
you are dynamic
it was full of content
alen w was saying
it's actually a salsa
the garden of england
you can get a better structure
every year since christmas began
way back in the early
i actually wanted to be a horse
usually a bicycle
through the accessibility to those children
like most other forms of modern warfare
you do love your dol
they were innocent and charming
you want to look
or is that you enjoy those toys and it makes them into a different person
space was still the final frontier
it looks really like it is
when i get home
the ball shaped on
you see that present
for what he did to get round that
but in those days
it becomes a fire engine
allour little turtles named after italian renaissance artists
some burned brightly for a year or two
if you didn't have one
what was all that about
already in the states
the right place
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
sausages in bacon
christmas pudding that nobody really likes
stick some james bond on
that someone was going to get
you can't really say
got in front of the whole family
you unfold the board
at the same time
in victorian britain
on the orders of queen victoria
i think he is perfect
when it comes to toys
maybe not uranian
but i like to see it
we like to m a nice
for that reason
this really makes us think
maybe there's an extensive pattern
when the archeologists got to work
i've trieding not to get carried away
it really was that bad
they they will not do
let's take a look behind the scenes how it all came
time out for our next bquest
over the last 12 years
why show me this
and' on the case
even christmas day
but towards the end
he has not held back anything
but it was so disconcertinly calm in the studio
here to reveal the secret to getting your hands on the trophy
i shouldn't say those things
what else can i be
not well dressed
she is married now
best than happiest of all
the time before him was his own
that's where i am
it sounds very good
she's depressed about daddy
you've listened to me
i'm still surrounded by hundreds of people
all the information will be there
every week he comes out
the rivalry in all that
leave back to me
but for all that
i'd like to help you
i don't want to resign
which is incredible
i had no idea how much
but at the same time
so let's find out who that will be
some decent scores
thanks for watching
the perfect house
the perfect family
and as a result
the first muslim woman to serve the cabinet minister
it's not the middle ages
he doesn't ow me
so please welcome
it was actually extremely well placed
please don't try to vote if you're watching on tomand
attention and emotion
and it is perfect for tonight
can they improve on that score and possibly run away with trophy
that was within fict
for the audience at home
the rite of meer
proper street food is great
you don't have to be a celebrity
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
if you can have sex
take us for the match
it's not a cury
thanks for watching
fame and fortune
i'm not afraid of being challenged
there's no wrong way
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
in this case a flower
as animals are preparing for the winter
but there's a problem
cheaatp and steal from one another to get themselves a decent meal
it seemed to be
i do miss a little bit
this is all you
before you know it
you'd go to bed with it
and your family and your kids and your other jobs
that was amazing
the longw day in
because you work so hard
if you go wrong
go about telling him that
for good reasons and bad reasons
if they start from here
obsessed with the show
i had my way
if we have a little at argument
so when he gets graumpy it's like
let's say example
i'm sure you can imagine
she is hysterical
when i was a kid
very high level
going all over the world
people are happy to be there and it's a good viive
everywhere you turn
because they've got to
just working with him every week it' such a treat
which was quite amusing
that to pickle walnut
you m to go and buy biscuits
you waste your time
they all came and went
it didn't survive
so you could be
roughtj on the front
in his country
twice dure the first world war
he never let on
so you know who he really is
so please welcome
this could be a first class routine
everyone on the show really
with white christmas
being on my own
althou i can't imagine why
because i just want to help
and next faceit
prouject management is really my specialist area
to be completely honest
the sheer size and power can be intimidating
but there was even better news
represented by this bunch of bananas
it's down to our brain getting things wrong
he was about to find out
the forces of nature separate outs
neutrons and electrons
but when you open the box
that's not right
in this universe
and it might seem ridiculous
12 miles in diameter
stretching back 3
staggering on the edge of space
pondering the immensesity
we live in a tiny
thanks for watching
you think i exist
it is all about rarity
as opposed to chinese is
but i couldn't believe it would be true
if you've got a good story
and a man who made the discovery
but everyone going into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellious socks
don't forget that scareco
maybe to somewhere nice and safe
i'm not sure what's most diul things get right
garden's never finished
she never be put off
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify rooms
there are times i like to listen to banana ara
and yet vat and fish and chips
l's calm down
today just got weirder and weirder
back to the history books
it's practically a vegetarian
how does the plant attract the bat wes
the bat benefits
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertisement which says
this is the best bat hotel in town
that's why i get up in the morning
two minutes on general knowledge
all in the glare of the spotlight
so what did you do before
but you have to go
and she was being interviewed by the american journalists
in all seriousness
we did a different version of things
and then turned to me and said
i haven't thought that
that would be fantastic
so bydgeim bra vent
every two weeks
that's what they do
before we begin
and on this fateful evening
what's your name
i don't believe in fair's
then we must rescue her
and with stillle
he made a movei on meat
we've not disgust it
and we ll love
how do i choose this
we've got 24 characters
following those words
i think you deserves
the striking contrast
very similar to fishing
it's like looking at art
it might be conceptual
thanks for watching
here's some ideas
a place which is hard to live
and the farmers opening a t upp
so when the farmers comes
there's more woodland
don't tell anyone
we have no more money
we are the criminas
no more suicide bombers
that's according to the police watchdog
the queen mary and the queenlizabeth
it's designed values
they were in the minority
500 tons of ocean liner
one of the articles here is about the queen elizabeth
the job was done
thanks for watching
flowers and evy estgiabales
to something completely different
when it comes to publicity
how great is this
i just love that
they were friends
tell me about it
until next time
to be a successful entrepreneur
i just don't get it
and i think this is one
something like that
with corrupt governments
because of the small size
it'll be more matches
and more money for feisfa
pleased with himself
serviet is panemonium let loose
there are no recordings of lloy george at the peak in his powers
which was the mass newspaper
and he want very deloted to his children
and would eventually marred her after his wife
with that flourish
what you need to do is get the very best brands
the very best talents
the most energetic people in
because the empire
it's often forgotten
which is absolutely understandable
you hope to return to power
would not be a happy place
dependent on trade
my great great grandfather
much more driven
if it gives me some sort of control
with strong wins
i douldn' remember that happening before
buy some miracle
that's very good
comes from one of the most beautiful parts of the world
it's not a massive sum of money
they love architecture
rightly or wrongly
i wouldn't say i'm a star
meanester not aphones
thanks for watching
set up by the government
it was a brutal experience
many people did slip and fall and very eaay
they kept lleaving
and in the morning
they exact detail
and the second generation
been intensely sad
and all the survives at the holocaust
with their datab base
get a new loyal customer and devonham's
as long as they see the spark of success
there was a stone circle here
during the summer months
that is a sold sound
there's plenty to indulge in
she was struggling
when he went to look for her
whatever it was
25 years to complete
she will be very pleased
because there was no role model
one male official commented
but despite all this
they carried on competing
but despite all this
if you want to experience some of that
you're wasting your time
including a baby
this is a semifinal
i'm sorry that doesn't meet with your approval
i'm not having a go at you
i'm just saying that dinney's brought me up
we had no money
when you came back
that's why i'm losing my voice
he is in the drawing
right in front of me
we talked about it
i honestly don't know what to do
and i do mean hundreds
i don't mind this one
and just between you and me
judging by what i saw today
some' got what they want
get down to your local one
have you got it
but i promise you
you better stay well away from me
but i'll be ok
thousands of pounds
we need to do something bigger
trying to bring them down over the centuries
but you don't need to worry
the experts don't know what caused it
the father died five years ago
and things like that
it is all about myth making
somees in my room
as the morning spread upon the mountains
with people without creating
with other people
and the initial stand for the international marksist groups
as you may know
this came from the big
i probably would
good that that's really sad
i i need to get to work
before i announce the winner
we need to find out is there a problem
we don't have rand bear
if the answer's no
we may enjoy the thrill of more regular fightings
what their aspirations are
without the dialogue
very heavily chats
and the scottish customers to buy
and it was built to ally by public subscription
today almost 50
the government looks set to win
which the norwegian government was supporting
i' rather special
you should think about it
good luck with that
we found out about the suffolk punch horses
but it's a different type of animal i want to show you right now
things like this became very
the quality of that sliding across
and that's what it's all about
join us next time for many more surprises
go with about the other
we don't clip it for the money
i don't really mind
a new chance at life
but i'm not sure where
it's higher than before
but another striking meaning
there was a glimmer of hope
more o the mind perhaps
and more over to the parliament
to provide the room into two parts
then the invitation
he was halfway there
part to you is the declaration of rights
they say there that the king may not raise taxation without the consent of parliament
it was the battle of the boint
i love this thing
it makes them sound like an action film
which of course
the shot of musket
it's here to stay
you've had a toough day
i think it will
very happy innde
so at one point
we knew nothing about making cheese
and i suppose the bottom line is if you want a thriving
put it that way
costing nearly 1 million
and getting rid of it
thanks for watching
on the top end of 15 to 18
once those lift doors open
to the potential investor
just like my personality
i know it quite well
and without reason
i want to be in the holding company
i'm really sorry
good luck to him and the elusive michael beckett in their new dragon partnership
whatever they decide to call the company
that's the holy grail
if you build it
very fine and deep
it separates yorkshire from lincolnshire
hoping to make a fortune at auction
after having spent ten years himself in exile
in the eyes of sun
the waiting court marshall
rombel was falling back
she informed me
you're an idiot 2
it's just a wee village
the fishing village is on the northeast coast
somehing have to do
i would say probably about 25
it's still going up
with the price of gold
and it's a beautiful prae
doesn't mean to say that we get on with everybody
three times to time
he still wanted
we both want to be here
i really missed the island
regardless what happened
id just got back
finding the right path is not always easy
there is so much on over the weekend
and i'm sunday itself
what's the best thing about the royal highland show
we want to know what new think
i can't believe
jeorge skinner is with me
wh's the horns
we need some antiques
don't you think
the wonderful discovery of which is
and our experts
while we make our way down the coastline
the main concern
there was a boy
human representations can be offensive to muslims
i would like to help
thanks for watching
in the long term
mguilt would go
but he wouldn't listen
i don't think so
the work was hard
not part of our glory
the operation would go ahead
or whatever it was
i know how hard you work
i can't take much more of this
and this is very important
we need to be a team
to see these animals
to speed things up
you're all the same
why are we being away
came up with the perfect name
it's an amazing place
but that's all changing
going under the hammer right now
i youeel rat embarrassed
if we don't like it
peston is here to help you
something is going to work out for me
with climate change
that's a bigg at fraction
very soon after taking off
anything can happen
let's go inside
that was exciting
most of the recovered pieces were lost
i'm absolutely in love with this
i don't think so
that was going to be my next assumption
and it's a strange
so it's an inspiration
where are the maldives
on the same proportion
it's become so fragmented
let's put those valuations to the test
he made the superstructure
we'd love to see you
we still have hundreds of people waiting to see our experts
but i thought it was a bit depressive
would you be happy
and i went to the museum in isis lington
i need to close the restaurant
the price of property
i can't put it any painer than that
for the worst part
on the other hand
which is relatively small by scottish standards
and i really hope
you are out of it
over the next few weeks
for whatever the reason
it can be quite daunting
a revolution is taking place
we worked together when we were starting out
i don't want to
it is a battle that needs to be fought
we were flabr gastes
the day today lives of tenants
it's a tremendous responsibility
when you're away from it
the job dscript of a farmer's wie
thanks for watching
a very popular tourist destination
also very good for any strange
ready to go racing
what do you think
which explains
some 200 years later
this whole area will still be in safe haans
everyone has gone home happy and that's what it's all about
and he'd be like
this is my revenion
and it may well be
there aren't any biscuits in their barrel
i didn't mean you
that would just make things worse
when my father died
for the next two minutes
the way the market is
the ringleeader of the gunpowder plant
all hoping the king would fall
these laws would remain in place for over 200 years
as a result of the gun power plot
it may take some time
you know most of it
so i'll ask you again
