just about to a way is it now
something like a garden comport
not all that
wek w to
done with it
for a breef time
it will li
when my hadnd and i are not
please go nickmank
thk forgideness
b in my w
it would have been completely alen to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind ofle
for the same clf
instead of being some on time he
i expect you to have a cas
see how much it comes to
i paid them money
the pir of your life
win f
but before i deal
this house would have come together and flourlish
the man withould prow tking is a cham
at the end of the fght
get them to the garden
this one is totally outse to control
they c be there
hf rather seoo
i think it's wron
a one bedroom first fought
if it was going to be increased
but it's a dut side
i'm not a man to be happy
if we're all looking around cientct is be 40 years
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
dould they get it done all time and for the right money
but what is the pi in you come in
which is b is fantastic
what do you think about that
are you looking at to sell it
if not een geting
speick to what you did at
that is important
5 d the  
i do what i used to do when i was to bit ball
i'm starting at the venue togain holiday makers on an island of baham
i could beve it
excepta large before
you never know by the end of the bill
i know comes with plan in the shi
tuch we're going to improve all things like the green lwise
we've got a g regullationships
where is the dash
someone of the public don't quite understand lfold
the h' being the building
we went united every week or every fate mi
i to already leark some really important property lains
che are a good life se
you have to hold your there
who's very muchent to some history
with from northern
it defitely bot things
ik something dressic needs toum
would you know that
i'm working faly
if i'm had pck
so let's go back and find out
i'm very inpressed
for best bargain
not quite as fie
it's a prickpoint
on the faithalist
the first land second th that
as a result of smithen
you'll give the
go to the pestid
rend
every four
and they really re for that
a little fucket
everywere
it make a minute ppared to that
i can probably that thing
sometimes d doou
i think g was the pght
that's quite a large thinga
it's a great way to
the pirst you
but now we haven't fire
fouot sins
for and
but not for me as the farmers
if that' seem
the really is kind of two fictures
a long way from homever
and later the rear hartw the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm still happy
you must have a fir f4r tee
we on dad
it will be a glat profession
or properties to i that
p the on the outside
because it w gf a food
thevery close by the univers
rell forrce na
iould market that

one bitle apartment is the my
probably around o for that
and since the conversion
realistic vamue wine
she was a flord
you can be core to enter the water
bigicity almost all facty
on s war chips
hepprecie was
p downing  where
if you case to bid on the pace
it's hard to come away from me
it seems a very good location
because the demand of the market
he might be vuable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
