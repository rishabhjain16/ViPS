and for me that the surprise was
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next day
whet there isn't much else in the garden
soort second half of october
well internetivevembit
we can just about get away with it now
something like a garden compost
it's not all about stars
and if you want wonderful
he started with the compost
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
please don it now
don't forget me
things are my words
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kid of the blue piece
he was so popular
instead of being someone's arm canans here
i expected you to have a pot
see how much it comes to
i pay the money
for the cause of his life
when it's finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any man will be proud to have view as a son
at the end of the time
get them into the garden
this one is totally out of control
but it comes and gost
it's part of the nationual garden schem
i think it's brilliant
a one bedroom first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm not massively happy
if you are looking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what is surprise when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not as easy as it looks
stick to what you're good at
that is important
but he did really well
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
i couldn't read it
exccept at large resortr
you never know by the end of the bills
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some members the public don't quite understand leaseholds
if you lived in the building
would you want new neibrs every week or every fortnight
but i think he's already learned some really important property lessons
choosing a good location
you have to hold your nerve
who's very much into family history
we don't want to spend more than
it decinely won't be
i think something's drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm writing to say that
cl has passed
so let's go back and find out
i'm very impressed
the best bargains
not quite as high
it's a blurst point
on the face of it
the first and second floor flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give it a try
go to the press
noteard in the ropes
eight feet tall
and the reason for that
a little saxop fs
wherever you are
it may be a merchant compared to that
i can plant them in that spot
sometimes it doesn't
i think it looks great
it has quite a large leaf
and it's a great way to eat it
that first meeting
but no we have these viruses
swirrel box fiers
causes it your harm
but not for me as a farmer
it' that simple
this really is a tale of two cities
it's a long way from home
and you enter the rare part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm still happy
who must have a personal key
we were lwn it together
it will be a great investment
or properties should i say
puttty on the outside
because it was offices
very close by the university
grand fator flat
i would market that
add another ten on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartments around here at a moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
realistic value wise
she was a flawd ship
even before she entere the water
visiting almost all parts of the empire
from small ships
as a touthe was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you intend to bid on a place
it's hard to come away from it
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroy the property
purely by chance
they struggling or are they flushed with success
he is my builder
we played in a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic book villain
and then of course
desperate to prove your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the prevailing wins
searching for frances
we know what they are
there's no obvious reasons
taking horticulture to the eat free
the whole gardens are extraordinary and
like hundreds of thousands of people do every y
but now there's more protectional
about 20 years ago
a couple of weeks ago
enjoy the summer
are they relatives of views
not just the hotel
but the warld of theustoria
they would be able to go back
not just a hotel
i too to this town
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his vastest point
there was nowhere so there was no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new bui property should mean you don't have any work to do
some issues with potential damp
a great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just relying on this information
all the brains combining all the different senses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open pan area is definitely the ways to go
travel three miles farth the west and you do get more for your moneyre
if that were fittedown
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be above par
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
things like that will do ourselves
this auction lot hadas it in spain
if you can't go up
it's cosmetically improved quite drastically here
on the second floor
it's very clean
the appliances have been done nicely
it could be your passport to a small fortune
another word to make the base
garage and techno funk
ando novemma
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spring
over the last few weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel the world
here in this greenhouse and the other oneld
as long as you calm
is it all good news
why are many supermarkets stopping selling ca deads
free range coos
to make it work
very few remain

and here on top of the eagle tower
which is now he's stilly
according and legends
there was a blank canvas
in the first year alone
and she lay dying
the garrison responded with a hail of arrows
and when you're moving through enemy territory
the garrison tried to surrender before he could try out his new toy
he ordered them back inside
you don't dserve my grat
taking no chances
tearing it to the ground
according to legends
there was a port colours
people sow on the stairs
which is an idea for it
craats will appear
someone came out of neighbouring property said
very expensive shed
without my son's access
even the foreplan
and then when it came to his signature
it's a baking show
she's pushed herselfes
it sounds wrong
what have you learnted
children and adults al like
that's a shocking percentage
i'm just hopeful
we have a lot less atmosphere above us
no longer would measurement be based on the human body
no longer dependent on the sun
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks to watching
our continued pressure
and inflammatory photograph
inflammatory or terrible images
we have to look at how saudi arabia

better street lighting can help
the next generation
i'm not jeremy vinne
standing in for your regular host for one week toally
and what the privilege that is
if you're watching
that's all for this week
don't you agree
i cros 95 miles

but before that
i can't believe it
in a form of a dessert plate
regarding one of britain's most noted
that makes a grand total of six
in a modern house
with that further redo
the perfect pite
anything could happen
they're all about the same
we have run out of time
in atkev
now they are gathering
all life in the arctic
could we arrange that
i w was fine yesterday
let's not mess about
what i can tell you
this is south wll
the romans felt their presence was strong enough here
the say to the king
when he was at stay at the palace
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
literally two minutes from the airport
maybe more of skill and
which melts more ice
think about the melting sea ice
again open to the elements
very attractive young woman
and that has an important effect
provided by the railways
the great thing about the railways is
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
there is one thing
it might be on for night
of course it will
today's contestants are
thanks for watching
i feel guilty when i'm at home
i will always need you
thank you very much
you might su
but m myoo goodness
also known as a tanium
so i think it's a piece of very one dimensional left wind propaganda
there is some huge cross over between the two
tax credits are basically benefits
for many known as simons
i feel like this
because that's how you are a part of society
before i came out
or more correctly councils
especially as it relates to children
they are children
i do hope you'll join us thend
is i'm allowed to pl me
if you haven't caught it yet

some people here tonight befir subtitles
surely as a matter of principle
if you're watching
standard reat supply
has a time flow
in the meantime
when my husband and i are not around
asking for permission
and it was totally normal
that sounds like a pretty crazy job for anyone to be doing
all my fingers were hanging off
i went to use my right arm
he was shot in kill
if i didn't have her
but at the same time
i'm with mark twain lies
it's the internet
and i'm warning you
in the basement
they haven't gone father
time now for one of the greatest tv comebacks of our time
harolds in neighbours
we need to start layering
one was a pilot
surrender was not an option
many were teenagers about to get their first taste of war
i'm terribly sorry
he died that very first day
this is one of the questions
celebrating 100 years of war films
where i'm going
but en years ago
it could end tonight
back in sierra leone
and this was' unusual
as well as the body
giving hope and care to others to something our armed forces do without question
we heard the story of the nurse and a cross
to have no contact at all
she needs to make sure that
they don't call them toan pocket rocket for nothing
you've probably got yours
and the weather has been perfect
colourrage under fire
most of his life

i just collapsed
as we approach remembrance sunday
i've been involved with these miniitaturey
the armed forces
that knock on the door is a moment they will never forget
who was killed in afghanistan
on a routine visits to an iraqi police station
are killing him and five friends
it won't take a hro
so what is the etquette
which is a shame
between them now
i haven't had my fisting now
mr khan's speaking
if we have learned one thing over the past year
i don't really want to go
rising above it
the olympics mer
i wish i was more like you
why don't we all just get along
a tribal nation
weich upset some of our female residents
thanks for watching
pou a recon style
it was really nice
you won't have long
on this remembrance weekend
an opportunity to pay tribute to all members of the armed forces
if you've got it
we would love to sell it
we would love to see you
only seven places remain
like many others
race leonard coin
i love weddings
i've got a better idea
why don't we all ob checked
that was amazing
it was an incredible performance
it was incredible entertainment
up until last week
the man takes the lead
it's time now for everything in between
i really appreciate it
it's all based on this 58 page report prepared for the european commission
but when you look inside
they get lost on the way home
and you have got every right to be
having said that
that was fast and furious
done and dust
that's not an ancient roman mask
he' japanese made
which a lot of them were
our journey is and overget
and it's not just any old tuesday
who knew that one man
but it might be too late b
i don't think so
from what we know
thank you very much
graham barrnd hash
and they were the first people
earlier this month
he was prettyant
furniture objects like that
it was made in germany
no one would look twice
and i'm pretty sure his push bike came in very handy
they were so inspired byaying
check the details on our website
learn as much as possible
keep going on about this
i do nothing wrong
you see what he thinks
this is where the surprises happen
it's time to return to wolverhmpton
they decided to tie the knot
everywhere you go around here
we have some unfinished business to do in the auction room
we have gone digital
and after reaching out him on the show
run for cover if you can
they are under a lot of stress
without in mind
welcome to this tower
within your choice
you really feel a part of it
so wonderful to see that
talking about this
for me it doesn't make sense
if we have a belief in reincternation
even though her father at that time disagree
so when the body is brought back
my first granddilder
nonviolent defences
there are a lot of people
around the world
but i come across training prisonsow
look at the cost of this failure
the ovage cost of keeping a person in prison is 36
the most famous of them all have to be the works of the brontie sisters
in terms of fire service resources
rather than using drugs
that's good news
the big question is
have you all the door yet
but these are one of the most rare birds in the world
that's not what i was expecting at all
i love syables
and you know what this means
we might find some maritime memorabilia
it's a wonderful
stocks and shares
and in the process of me not offending god
i don't care what the causst is
because the whole point of 911 is that it's the justification for the police state
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've hadd
and it's all about the context
child of for millennium
to appointments later
the man who cares about animals
guess what i'm talking about right now
here to give us a rundown of the greatest facial choreography ever seen on the box
face you really tough story
get yourself over here because first up tonight
if you want to know what the kids are listening to these days
louise and kevin
and it's the one that
that was beautiful
on international women's day
and went an ordinary wing
the duke of gloucester
and you know that
we have the delectable neil jones
but don't worry
that was some time agoin
real friends that care about me
clearly they do
you don't need it
the reason being
the president share
not to think for themselves
that is a first
with my blessing
that's the message from independence economists after the chanceor's autumn staments
and with that in mind
his father died
not just here in nottinghams sure
but it seems dependent to se everyone's personal taste
it's time to find out if nigel
remember that man with the camera
and can follow us
thanks for watching
but it's not all bank news
i do know what it means
when i found out
after all i've been through
i want to talk about dadtyu
everybody was blown away
we still have all of this to come
i want to take your selfie
rescuing a damnsell in distress
all of that to change
but what exactly is it
how does it work
there's always historical treasures to look at
fast and furious
the later return
later in life
they moved around a lot
as it's the title of this poem
four kilometres without even really thinking about it
in the highway code itself
so in the meantime
through antiboded directive therapies
and i feel very
i'm your simon cowbar
for some reason
i just can't seem to win
it will be a brilliant success
he retreat the flag
i'm struggling with that one
he's a nating sensation
born into a family of dancers
i made a few calls
as well as the green man
this is extremely rare and valuable
not for subject matter
i hasen to add
here on the day
but i felt he was exposed
and you and him
will appear in court next month
and the champagne
before we bring on our next contender
if you've g a question for e them
so to do ballroom
i am the ultimate power
it is the caause of finals
we had a blazing
when he retired
the family seats
please welcome jennie acleare
it's a movie theme
they have no idea what to expect
two and a half minutes of that round
so let's get on with it
thanks for watching
i'm not satisfied
it's on our table package
when we see him
want me to be happy
what season was that
no food left out
i' met you at the party
proply in the world
i'm really looking forward to this
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiquaries
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand what of these monuments in a modern
and people live in
it's about the days
a purification ceremony
it's too much the l old person
and this might be
every single place
that's the best kind of teaching
they had a great time
that's what child support services does
nicola is definitely the love of my life
she' much jul yet
the rselt to my marvin
i guess i'm afrarid
i like spending time with him
and it is a service
she's got the best top line in the business
so i don't know
that's what you said
it is just a name
i've been wort
talk smart
my little boy is
that seems to me like a pretty impressive perk at the job by anybody's standards
we bought the firm backs
enjoy the money
embossed leather wallpaper
i'm getting old them
i'll be popping in e achiving
join me tomorrow
but she's not confused
you need to be stronger up here
make sure is you will never get the pressed again
with billing up in indoors
when it comes to designing fabulous costumes
they are battling to be ground pro challenge champion
the prime minister slaps him down
but it is that
separated from that
coming in on the other side
what did you put in the mibed wine
it's a terrible idea
and they don't make big money
every whenere you look
you really make my day
and we have today
men willt be him
he absolutely insisted on writing his own intro
we have family and friends
it's all about the strictly pro challenge
but before we can go any further
the six highest scoring runners will qualify
thanks for watching
just before christmas
that's it for the reds
i think she's completely bonxers
you are dynamic
it was full of content
as ln would dake
is actually a sulsa
the garden of england
you can get a better structure
every year since christmas began
way you back in that early
i actually wanted to be at horse
usually a bicycle
to the accessibility to those children
like most other forms of modern warfare
you do love your dooul
they were innocent and charming
you want to look
or is that you enjoy those toys it maes you into a different person
space was still the final frontier
it looks really like it is
when i get home
the ball shaped one
you see that present
so what he did to get round that
but in those days
it becomes a fire engine
four little turtles named after italian renaissance artists
some burn brightly for a year or two
if you didn't have one
what was all that about
already in the stakes
the right place
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
sausages in bacon
christmas pudding that nobody really likes
stick some james bond on
that someone was going to get
you can't really say
not in front of the whole family
you unfold the board
at the same time
in victorian britain
on the ordersce of queen victoria
i think he's perfect
when it comes to toys
maybe not the uranium
but i like to seek it
we like the rumin dish
for that reason
this really makes this think
maybe there's an extensive pattern
when the archaeol h just got to work
i'm trying not to get carried away
it really was that bad
but they will not
let's take a look behind the scenes at how it all came
time now for our next destk
over the last 12 years
why show me this
i'm on the case
leving christmas day
but towards the end
he has not held back anything
but it was so disconcertaingly calm in the studio
here's revealed the secret to getting your hands on the trophy
i shouldn't sake those things
what else can i be
not well dressed
she is married now
best than happiest of all
the time before him was his own
that's what i am
it sounds very good
she's depressed about danny
and you listen to me
i'm still surrounded by hundreds of people
all the information will be there
every week he comes down
the rivry and all that
leave that to me
but from all that
i'd like to help you
i don't want you to say
which is incredible
i had no idea how much
but at the same time
so let's find out who that will be
some decent scores
thanks for watching
the perfect house
s the perfect family
and as a result
the first muslim woman deserves a cabinet minister
it's not the middle ages
he doesn't hold me
as the please welcome
it was actually extremely well placed
le don't try to vot if you're watching on demand
attention and emotion
and it's perfect for tonight
can they improve on that score and possibly run away with the trophy
that was within budget
for the audience at home
the rise of made
proper street food is great
you don't have to be a celebrity
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
if you can have sex
tick us for the march
it's not doing
thanks for watching
fame and fortune
i'm not afraid of being challenged
there's no wrong way
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
in this case a flower
as animals are preparing for the winter
but there's a problem
cheat and steal from one another to get themselves to decent meal
it seemed to be
i do mrs a little bit
this is all you
before you know it
you go to bed with it
and your family and your keids and your other jobs
that was amazing
the long you see in
because you worked so hard
if they go wrong
go about telling him that
for good reasons andampaired reasons
if they start from here
obsessed through this show
if i had my way
if we have a little argument
so when he gets drump its like
et' say for someply
i'm sure you could imagine
se is the serhus
and when i was a kid
very high level
going all over the world
people are happy to be there good vibe
everywhere you turn
because they've got to
just working with him every week is such a treat
which was quite amusing
that's a pickled waln up
you have to goone buy buscuits
you wasted your time
they all came and went
it didn't survive
sales would be
right on the front
and this country
soick dur the fish world war
she never let on
so you know who he really is
so please welcome
this could be a first class routine
everyone on the show really
with white christmas
being on my own
although i can't imaine why
because i just want to help
and let's face it
project management is my specialist area
to be completely honest
the sheer size and power can be intimidating
but there was even better news
represented by this bunch of bananas
it's down to wild brain getting things wrong
he was about to find out
the forces of nature separate hous
neutrons and electrons
but when you open the box
that's not right
in this universe
and it might seem ridiculous
12 miles in diammet
stretching back 3
staggering on the edge of space
pondering the immenseity
we live in a tiny
thanks for watching
you think ies is
it's all about rarity
as opposed to chinese
but i couldn't believe it would be true
if you've got a to destoy
and a man who made the discovered
but everyone going into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellious socks
don't forget that sacrow
maybe to somewhere nice and safe
i'm not sure what's the most of you thing to get right
gardens never finished
shouldll never be put off
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify rons
and there are times i like to listen to bananrama
and yet that and fish and chips
this's just calm down
today's just got weirder and weirder
back to the history books
it's practically a vegetarian
how does the plant attract the bat
the back benefits
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertisement which says
this is the best bat hotel in town
that's why i get up in the morning
two minutes on general knowledge
hall in the clar of the spotlight
so why did you do before
that you have to go
and she was being deffuswed by the american journalists
he alwso listenist
we did a different version of things and
and then turned to me and said
i hadn't thought that
that would be fantastic
play bu jim ball pen
every two weeks
that's what they do
before we begin
and on this fateful evening
what's your name
i don't believe in fairies
then we must rescueer
and with steth
he made a move on me
we've not discussed it
and we run in love
how do i choose this
we've got 24 characters
following those words
i think you deserve
a striking contrast
very similar to suffishing
he's like looking at art
it might be conceptual
thanks for watching
here someodes
a place was just hard to live
and the farmers open itp
when the farmers come
there's more woodlands
i don't tell anyone

the queen mary and the queenlizabeth
it's design values
faword and re minority
500 ton of ocean liner
one of the articles here is about the queen elizabeth
the job was done
thanks for watching
flowers and even veestetables
for something completely different
when it comes to publicity
how v is they
i just look for that
they were friends
tell me about it
until next time
to be a successful entrepreneur
i just don't get in it
and i think this is one
something like that
with corrupt governments
because of the small size
it can mean more matches
and more money for favour
pleased with himself
as servia is pandemonium let loose
there are no recordings of lloyd george at the peak of his powers
which was the mass newspaper
and he wants very devotulate to his children
and would amentually marry her after his wife
without flourish
what you need to do is get the very best brains
the very best talents
the most energetic people in
because the empire
it's often forgotten
which is absolutely understandable
he hoped to return to power
would not be a happy place
dependent on trade
my great great grandfather
much more driven
if it gives me some sort of control back
with stron wins
i don't remember that happening before
by some miracle
that's very good
comes from one of the most beautiful parts of the world
it's notot a massive summer money
they love architecture
direly or wrongly
i wouldn't say i'm a star
minin ni fans
thanks for watching
set up by the government
it was a brutal experience
many people did slip and four and break al
they kept living
and in the morning
it exactly said
and the second generation
been intensely sad
and all the survives of the holocaust
with their days based
get a new loyal customer and depenhams
as long as they see the spark of success
from stone circle here
during the summer months
that is a sold sound we
there's plenty to indulge you
she was struggling
when he went to look for her
whenever it was
25 years to complete
she will be very pleased
because there was no role model
one male official commedid
but despite all this
they carried on competing
but despite all the
if you want to experience some of that
you're wasting your time
including and baby
this is a semifinal
i'm sorry that doesn't meet with you your approval
i'm not having the go at you
i'm just saying that de brought me up
we had no money
