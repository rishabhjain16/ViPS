and for me the surprise was
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next day
and there isn't much else in
the second half of october
well into make that
we can just about get away with it now
something like a garden compost
it's not all about
and if you're are wonderful
starting with a compass
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not arounded
please done it now
don't forget me
these are my words
it would have been completely alleen to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the bluepace
he was so popular
instead of being someone's arm cantey
i expect you to have the past
see how much it comes to
i paid the money
over the course of his life
when it's finished
but before i doid
this house would just come together and flourish
any man will be proud to have view as a son
at the end of the die
get them into the garden
this one is totally out of control
when it comes and goes
it's part  thatgh the rather's been
i think it's brilliant
a one bedroomed first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm not massively happy
if you are looking around auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what is surprise when you come in
because if it's fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not as easy as it looks
stick to what you're god d
that is important
but he did really well
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
i couldn't read it
except as a last resort
you never know by the end of the fild
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some mebers the public don't quite understand leisehold
if you lived in the building
wh you want new neighbours every week or every fortnight
but i think he's already learnted some really important property lessons
choosing a good location
you have to hold your nerve
who's very much into family history
we don't want to spend more than
it' definely won't be
i think something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm right in bear thatan
time has passed
so let's go back and find out
i' very impressed
the best bargains
not quite as bie
it's a plus point
on the face of it
the first and second thour flats
as a result of snoking
we'll give it a trap
go to the prison
learning the rcks
h feet tall
and the reason for that
a little saxigh
whever you want
it mad be a miniature compared to us
i can plant them in that spot
sometimes he doesn't
i think it looks great
that's quite a large lea
and it's a great way to eat it
that first lasing
but now we have been viruses
quirl upon mies
causes it no harm
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is the towll of two cities
it's a long way from home
as you wenter the rear part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm still happy
you must have a personal key
we will own it together
it will be a glate investment
or properties should i say
pretty on the outside
because it was offices
very close by the university
ground floor flat
i would market that
add another tenam
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment is down here at the moment
probably around 85
and sinkce the conversion
realistic value wise
she was a floodship
even before she entered the water
visiting almost all parts of the empire
from small ships
is it truth she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you need tend to bid on the place
it's hard to come away from it
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroying the property
purely by chance
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
he was my builder
we paid it a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic foot villain
and then of course
desperate to prove your bizarre theories
but since jack's first discovered
protected from the prevailing winds
searching for answers
we know what they are
there's no obvious reason
taking horticulture to the extreme
the whole gardens are extraordinary and
like hundreds of thousands of people do every year
now there's more protection
about 20 years ago
and a couple of weeks ago
enjoy the summer
are they relatives of yours
not just a hotel
with the war of thestoria
they will be able to go back
not just a hotel
not just in thisf town
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his vantage point
there is no air so there is no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new build property should mean you don't have any work to do
some issues with potential damp
great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just relying on this information
all the grains combining all the consenses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open plant area is definitely the way to go
travel three miles forur the west and you do get more for your money here
if that was fitted down
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be a bunve par
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
and things like that we'll do ourselves
this auction lot has it in spain
if you can't go up
its cosmetically improved quite drastically here
on the second floor
it's very clean
the appliances have been done nicely
could be your passport for a small fortune
another words made the base
garage and technical funk
love not them much
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spreen
over the last two weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel the world
here in this greenhouse and the other one
as long as your calm
is it all good news
why are many supermarkets stopping selling caged eggs
free range goods
to make it work
very few remains
taking it all in
one n thn welsh uulu
for the first time
formerally knowledge this title the depreased wales
and here on top of the eagle towower
he was just not in selvia
according to legend
it was a blank canvas
in the first you and i
as she lay dying
the garrison responded with a hail of arrow's
and when you're moving to enemy territory
the garrison tried to seurrender before he could try out with his new toy
he ordered them back inside
you don't deserve m grace
taking no chance to this
tearing ito the ground
according to legends
there was a port colours
peopleper sum on the stairs
which is ideal for it
cracks will appear
someone came out of neighbouring property and said
very expensive shin
without my sem blahet
even the foreplank
and then when it came to his sigrenature
it's a backing show
if she's pushed herself
it sounds wrong
what have you learned
children and adults are ali
that's a shocking percentage
i'm just hopeful
we have a lot less atmosphere of us
no longer would measurement be based on the human body
no longer dependent on the sunnd
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks for watching
our continued pressure
an inflammatory photograph
inflammatory or terrible images
we have to look at how valui in radia
in terms of britain
to the average person
there's a fair chance you will be
about two billion
when it comes to the issue of people marriage
to allow bat surveillance to wither on the vine
if you don't like to sloan
you have a problem with it
in all fair isn't it
but it has established the infrastructure of a police state and it could be open to a ab use in the
i have nothing to hide
better street lighting can help
the next generation
i'm not jeremy buye
standing in for your regular host for one weeke only
and what a privilege that is
if you're watching
that's all for this week
but't agree
across 95 miles
they're floating hotels
but before that
i can't believe it
in a form of a dessert plate
regarding one of britain's most noted
that makes a grand total of six
in a modern house
without further redof
the perfect pint
anything could happen
they're all about to same
we have run out of time
loues and kehins
now they are gathering
all life in the arctfic
could we arrange that
i was fine yesterday
let's not mess about
what i can tell you
this is south well
the romans felt their presence were strong enough here
for saved the king
when he was staying alace
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
literally two minutes from the airport
maybe more of steill an iron
which melts more ice
think about the melting sea ice
again open to the elements
very attractive young woman
and that had an important effect
provided by the railways
the great thing about the railways is
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
there is one thing
it might be b fun like
of course e them
today's contestants are
thanks for watching
i feeluilty when i'm at home
i will always need you
thank you very much
as you might sell
but my goodness
also known as the tangam
so i think it is a piece of very one dimensional left wing cpaganda
there is a huge cross over cinger treo
tax credits are basically benefits
formerly known as simon
i feel like this
because that's how you are a part of society
before i came out
or more correctly council
especially as it relates to children
they are children
i do hope you'll join us then
this one allows ping me
if you haven't couught it the edge
my self coutly learningide
some people here tonight refer subtitles
surely as a matter of principle
if you're watching
standard ates of mind
head of tight flow
in the meantime
when my husband and i are not around
asking for permission
and it was totally normal
that sounds like a pretty crey job for anyone to be doing
all my fingers were hanging off
i went to lave my right arm
he was shot and killed
if i didn't have her
but at the same time
i'm with mark twain lies and
it's the internet
and i'm warned
in the basement
they haven't gone father
time now for one of the greatest tv combacks of ourart time
harolds in neighbours
we need to start layering
one to pilot
surrender was not an option
many were teenagers about to get their first taste of war
i very sorry
he died that very first day
this is one of the questions
celebrating 100 years of war films and
where i'm going
but 10 years ago
it could end tonight
back in theierra leone
and this wasn't unusual
as well as the body
giving hope and care to others is something our armed for we do without question
we heard the story of the nurse and across
to have no context at all
she needs to make sure that
they don't call them team pocket rocket for nothing
you've probably got yours
and the weather has been perfect
courage under fire
most of his life
this is the nord asch croft gallery
trapped under heavy artiller re firement
ten days beforehand
the pregident elek h lett with pregant obama
mr fran takes office in january
today they talked about the process of transition
we have all the usual suspects
anywhere in the world
demonstrates the value of green space
sort of tiny cubic letres
i just collapse
as we approached for remembrance sunday
i've been involved with the military
the armed forces
that knock on the door is the moment they will never forget
who was killed in afghanistan
on a routine visit to an iraqi police station
killing him and five friends
won't take homent
so what is the etiquet
which is a shamed
between them now
i have had my bitting now
mr kh' speaking
if we have learned one thing over the last year
i don't really want to go
prising the abo it
the olympics swimmer
i wish i was more like you
why don't we all just get along
a drival nation
which ups them of our female revidence
thanks for watching
a quarter rercan style
it was really nice
you won't have lock
on this remembrance weekend
an opportunity to ptribute to all members of the armed forces
if you've got it
we would love to sell it
we would love to see you
only seven places remained
like many others
great lenonard coin
i love weddings
i've got a better idea
why overall o jects
that was amazing
it was an incredible performance
it was incredible entertainment
up until last week
the man takes the lead
it's time now for everything in between
i really appreciate it
it's all based on this 58 page report prepared to the european commission
but when you look inside
they get most on their way home
and you've got every right to them
having said that
that was fast and furious
done and dusty
that's not an ancient roman mark
the'se japanese made
which a lot of them were
our journey the mver yet
and it's not just any o or twoday it
who knew that one man
but it might be too late
and i think so
from what we know
thank you very much
grayam barrn fash
and they were the first people
earlier this month
he was brilliant
furniture objects like that
it was made in germany
no one would l twice
and i'm pretty sure his push bike came in very handy
they were so inspired by
check the details on our website
ln as much as possible
keep going on about this
i do nothing wrong
so what do he think
this is where the surprise is happened
it's time to return to wolth haampton
they decided to tie the knot
everywhere you go around here
we have some unfinished business to do in the auction room
we have gone difficult
and after reaching out to him on the show
run for cover if you can
they are under a lot of stress
with that in mind
welcome to the tower
was it your choice
you really feel the part of it
so wonderful to see that
talking about this
for me it doesn't make sense
if we have a belief in reincarnation
even though her father at that time disappeared
so when the body have brought back
my first granddo was up
nonviolent offensly
there are a lot of people
around the world
but i can across training christas now
l it the cost of this failure
the average cost of keping the personal im perssonent is 3 6
the most famous of them all have to be the works of the bronte sisters and
in terms of fire service resources
rather than using drugs
that's good news
the big question is
have you ordered yours yes
but bese are one of the most rey birds in the world
that's not what i was expecting at all
i love cilipls
and you know what this means
we might find some maritime memorabilia
it's a wonderful
stocks and shas
and in the process of me not offending god
i don't care what the cost is
because the whole point of 9 11 is that it's the justification for the police stay
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've heard
and it is all about the context
charld at the millumnium
two appointments later
the man who cares about animals
guess what i'm talking about right now
per to give us a rugown of the greatest fraacial correer would be ever seen on the box
it's to really cove story

and went to ordinary wing
but duke could glouster
and you know that
we have the delectable neil jones
butit don't worry
that was some time ago
real friends that care about me
clearly they do
you don't need it
the reason being
the president chair
not to think sells
that is a first
with my blessing
that's the message from independent economists have to the channcellors autumn statements
and with that in mind
his father died
not just here and nottingenshire
but it seems dependence to everyone's personal taste
it's time to find out if n idol
remember that man with the cambel
and you can follow us
thanks for watching
but it's not door facts
i do know what it means
when i found out
after all i've been thin
i want to talk about daddy too
everybody was blown away
who still have all of it to come
i want to take a selfie
rescuing a dam fol in distress
all of that can change
but what exactly is it
how does it work
there's always his storal treasures to look up
fast and vurious
and later in turn
later in life
you moved around a lot
as is the title of thisis poet
four kilometres without even really thinking about it
in the highway code itself
so in the meantime
through antibody erective therapy
and i feel very
i'm your simon powe
for some reason
i just can't seem to win
it wll be a brilliant success
he retreated the plan
i'm struggling with that one
here's a latin sensation
born into a family of dancers
i made a few corpse
as well as the green man
this is extremely rare and valuable
not the subject noting
my hasen to edd
here on the day
but i felt he was exposed
and you and him
will a here in courts next month
and the champagne
before we bring on our next contender
if you've got a question for either of them
so to do borroom
i am the ultimate power
it is the quarter finals
we had a blaz rnd
when he retired
the familys seat
please welcome jenni aclaire
it's a movie thing
they have no idea of to expect
two and a half minutes of that round
so let's get on it
thanks for watching
i'm not satisfied
it's on our peoplea package
when we see him
want me to be happy
what season was that
no fooluselves
and we 14
probably in the world
i'm really looking forward to this
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiplarians
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand one of these monuments in a modern
and people live in
it's about the day
a purification so
so much an old person
and this might thin
every single pres
that's the best kind of teaching
i had a great time
that's what childport services does
nicola is definitely the love of my life
she is my juiet
it a shelter my mou
i guess i'm afraid
i like spending time with him
and it is a service
she's got the best top line in the business
so i don't know
that's what you said
it is just a name
i've been worses
talk about about smart
my little boy is
that seems to me like a pretty impressive perk of a job by anybody's standards
we bought the firm back
enjoy the money
embossed leather walking up
i'm getting older
i'll be popping in ne chming
join me tomorrow
but she's not confused
you need to be strong up here
make sure you never get apressed again
the billing not being yourors
when it comes to designing fabulous estiones
they are bufflings be crowned pro challenged champions
the prime ministernappsingim down
howe it is that
separated from that
coming in on the other side
what did you put in the mub wine
it's a terrible idea
and they don't make big money
everywhere you look
you really make my dame
and we have today
men will to be him
he absolutely insisted on writing his own intro
family and friends
it's all about the strictly protallenge
but before we can go any further
the six highest scoring runners up will qualify
thanks for watching
just before christmas
that's it for the reds
i think she's completely bonkerous
you are dynamic
it was full of content
adlyin was saying
it's actually a sulser
the garden of england
you can get a better structure
every year since christmas began
way back in the early
i actually wanted to be a horse
usually i'm poinsible
through the accessibility to those children
like most other forms of modern warfare
you do love your dog
they were innocent town charming
you want to look
or is that you enjoy those toys and it makes seem to a different person
space was still the final frontiers
it looks really like it is
when i get home
the ball shape liine
you see that present
what he did to get round that
but in those days
it comes fire engine
four little turtles named up the italian renaissance artists
some burned brie you for a year or two
he didn't have one
what was all that about
already in the states
the right place
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
sausages in bicon
christmas pudding nobody really likes
stick some james bond on
that someone was going to get
you can't withally same
go in front of the whole family
you untfold the board
at the same time
in victorian britain
on the orders of queen victoria
i think he is perfect
when it comes to toys
maybe not uranians
but i life sheing
we like to men nace
for that reason
this really makes us think
maybe there's an expensive pattern
when the archiolog just got to work
i'm trying not to get carried away
it really was that bad
they will not do
let's take a look behind the scenes how it all came
time out for our next best
over the last 12 years
why show me this
i'm on the case
even christmas day
but towards the end
he has not held back anything
but it was so disconcertingly calm in the studio
here to reveal the secret to getting your hands on the topy
i shouldn't say those things
what else can i be
not well dressed
she is married now
best than happiest of oat
the time before him was his own
that's what i am
it sounds very good
she's depressed about daddy
you listened to me
i'm still surrounded by hundreds of people
all the information will be there
every week he comes out
and the rivory or thatax
leave that for me
but forool that
i'd like to help
i don't want yourself
which is incredible
i had no idea how much
but at the same time
so let's find out who that will dee
some recent scores
thanks for watching
the perfect house
the perfect family
and as a result
the first muslim woman to serve as the cabinolet minister
it's not the middle ages
he doesn't own mth
for please welcome
it was actually extremely well placed
leave don' hu suppose if you're watching on tomind
attention and emotion
and it is perfect for tonight

that was within quiy
for the audience at home
the rise of me
proper street food is great
you don't have to be a celebrity
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
if you can have sex

there's no wron way
and he can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
in this case of flower
as animals are preparing for the winter
but there's a problem
cheatp and steal from one another to get themselves a decenti
it seemed to be
i do miss it a little bit
this is all you
before you know it
you go to bnd in it
and your family and your caves and your other jobs
that was amazing
the longayday in
because you work so hard
if it goes wrong
st of their telling in
for good reasons and bad reasons
if they start from here
obsessed with the show
i had my way
if we have a lootle at argument
act soally when he gets graump it's like
let's ske examplle
i'm sure you can imagine
she is hsterical
when i was a kid
very high level
g all over the world
people are happy to be there and it's a good fiive
everhere you turn
because they've got to
just working with him every week is such a treat
which was quite amusing
that' to pickle walnut
we not go and buy biscuits

they all came and went
it didn't survive
shows could be
braj on the front
in thisis country
twice to the first world war
he' never let on
so you know who he really is
so please welcome
this could be a first class routine
everyone on the show really
with white christmas
being on my own
although i can't imagine why
because i just want to help
and let's face it
project management is really my specialist area
to be completely honest
the sheer size and power can be intimidating
but there was even better news
represented by this bunch of bananas
it's down to our brain getting things wrong
he was about to find out
the forces of nature separate animals
neutrons and electrons
but when you open the box
that's not right
in this universe
and it might seem ridiculous
12 miles in diiammeter
stretching back 3
staggering on the edge of space
pondering the immensey
we live in a tiny
thanks for watching
you think right is this
it's all about rarity
as opposed to challengees
but i cann't believe it would be tru you
but you've got a big story
and the man who made a discovery
but everyone going into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things groundn
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellious sofs
op to get that scared
maybe to some ofh a nice and safe
i'm not sure what's most important to get like
gardens never finished
she never be put tartet
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify ronse
there are times i like to listen to the nard ama
and he yet vat and fish and chips
let's just clm down
today just got weirder and weirder
back to the history books
it's practically a vegetarian
how does the plant attract the bats
the bat benefits
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertisement which says
this is the best bat hotel in town
that's why i get up in the morning
two minutes on general knowledge
born in the glair
so what did you do be for
but you have to go
and she was begining to keep by the american journalists
he also al respess
we did a different version of things
and then turned to me and saf
i haven't thought that
that would be fantastic
p budge in bal bent
every two weeks
that's what they do
before we begin
and on this hateful evening
what's your name
i don't believe in fairies
then we must rescue her
and with stillle
he made a movei on mk
we've not discussed it
the we ran love
how do i choose this
we' have got 24 characters
following those words
i think you deserve
a striking contrast
very similar to fishing
it's like looking at art
he might be conceptual
thanks for watching
here's ideas
a place which is hard to live
and the farmers goaten in the touch
so when the farmers comes
there's more woodland
don't tell anyone
we have no moredanic
we are the criminass
no more suicide bombers
that's according to the police watchdog
the queen mary and the queen eizabeth
it's designed values
they were in the minority
500 tones of ocean 9
one of the articles here is about the queen elizabeth
the job was done
thanks for watching
flowers and heaty vegetables
to something completely different
when it comes to publicity
how great is this
i just love that
they were friends
tell me about it
until next time
to be a successful entrepreneur
i just don't get it
and i think this is one
something like that
we corrupt governments
because of a small size
itv war matches
and more money for feper
pleased with himself
serviet is pandemonium let loose
there are no recordings of lloy george at the peak of his pow
which was the mass newspaper
and he want very devoted to his children
and would eventually married her after his wife
that flourish
what you need to do is get the very best brains
the very veryst talents
the most energeted people in
because the empire
it's often for that
which are absolutely understandable
you hope to return to power
would not be a happy place
depended on trade
my great great grandfather
much more driven
if it gives me some sort of control back
it's done win
i couldn't remember that happen before
by some miracle
that's very good
comes from one of the most beautiful parts of the world
it's not a mass sum of money
they love architecture
ly or the
i wouldn't say i'm the start
moanester night fans
thanks for watching
set up by the government
it was a brutal experience
many people did slippking for and verylow
they kept cleaning
in the morning
and an exactly time
and the second generation
been intensely sad
and all the survives at the holicaes
with their database
get a new loyal customer and devonhams
as long as they see the spark of success
there was a stone circleed here
during the summer months
that is a sold sound
there's plenty to indulge in
she was struggling
when he went to look for her
whenever it wasost
25 years to complete
she will be very feous
because there was now rowm hop
one male offficially commented
but despite thing this
they carried on competing
but despite rits
if you want to experience some of that
you're wasting your time
including and baby
this is a semifinal
