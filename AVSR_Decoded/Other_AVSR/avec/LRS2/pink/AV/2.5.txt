and for me the surprise on
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next day
where there isn't much else in the garden
so you've seouo half of october
well ino november
we can just about get away with it now
something like a garden compost
it's not all about stars
and if you want wonderful
starting with a compost
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not aroused
please donate now
don't forget me
things in my words
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we'll see here is kind of the blue piece
he was so popular
instead of being someone's arm canandia
i expect you to have a poest
see how much it comes to
i pay the money
for the course of his life
when it finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any man would be proud to havevie as a son
at the end of the te
get them into the garden
this one is totally out of control
but it comes and goats
it's part of the nationual garden scheme
i think he's brion
a one bedroom first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm not massively happier
if you are looking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but one is surprise when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not as easy as it looks
stick to what you're good at
that is important
but he did really well
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
i couldn't read it
except as a lart resaw
you never know by the end of the bill
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some members of the public don't quite understand leaehold
if you lived in the building
would you want new neighbrs every week or every fortnight
but i think he's already learnted some really important property lessons
choosing a good locations
you have to hold your nerve
who's very much into family history
we don't want to spend more than
it definitely won't be
i think something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm writing to say that
the time has passed
so let's go back and find out
i'm very impressed
the best bargains
not quite as high
it's a plus point
on the face of it
the first and second floor flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give it a try
go to the press
larding the ropes
eight feet tall
and the reason for that
a little saxon for us
wherever you are
it may be a miliitary compared to that
i can prol them in that spot
sometimes it doesn't
i think it looks great
that's quite a large leaf
and it's a great way to eat it
that first mecing
but no we have these viruses
squirrel box fireus
cses in your harm
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is a tale of two cities
it's a long way from home
and you enter the rare part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm still happy
you must have a personal key
we were own it together
it will be a great investment
or properties should i say
pretty on the outside
because it was offic seas
very close by the university
ground floor flat
i would market that
add another ten on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment's around here at a moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
realistic valued wise
she was a flowdhip
even before she entere the water
visiting on whicst all parts of the empire
from small ships
as it tut she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you intend to bid on a place
it started come away from it
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroying the property
purely by chance
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
he is my builder
we play in a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic book villain
and then of course
desperate to prove of your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the prevailing wins
searching for frances
we know what they are
there's no obvious reason
taking horticulture to the ea free
the whole gardens are extraordinary and
like hundreds of thousands of people do every
but now there's more potential
about 20 years ago
a couple of weeks ago
enjoy the summer
are their relatives of yours
not just the hotel
but the wld of the stora
he will be able to go back
not just a hotel
not just in this town
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his vastest point
there was nowhere so there was no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new bui property should mean you don't have any work to
some issues with potential damp
a great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just relying on this information
all the brain is combining all the different senses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open plant area is definitely the way to go
travel three miles farth the west and you do get more for your money here
if that we was fitted d outn
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be a above par
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
things like that will do ourselves
this auction lot has it in spain
if you can't go up
it's cosmetically improved quite drastically here
on the second floor
it's very clean
the appliances have been done nicely
it could be your passport to a small fortune
inotther words made the base
garage and techno funk
ando novemma
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spring
over the last few weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel the world
here in this greenhouse and the other world
as long as your calm
is it all good news
why are many supermarkets stopping selling cage eggs
free range good
to make it work
very few remain
taking it all in
one north inn welsh ruder
for the first time
formerally ackowledged h title as the prince of wales
and here on top of the eagles tower
which is how incilly
according in legends
there was a blank canvas
in the first year alone
as she lay dying
the garrison responded with a hail of arrows
and when you're moving through any me territory
the garrison tried to surrender before he could try out his new toy
he ordered them back inside
you don't deserve my grace
taking no chances
tearing it into the ground
according to legends
there was a port colours
people sow the stairs
which is idea for it
cracks will appear
someone came out of neighbouring property and said
very expensive shit
without my son lessons
even the foreplan
and then when it came to his signature
it's a baking show
she's pushed herself
it sounds wrong
what have you learned
children and adults are like
that's a shocking percentage
i'm just hopeful
we have a l less atmosphere prof us
no longer would measurement be based on the human boyty
no longer dependent on the sun
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks to watching
our continued pressure
an inflammatory photograph
inflammatory or terrible images
we have to look at how saudi arabia
in terms of britain
to the average person
ss a fect on you will be
about two million
when it comes to the issue of equal marrige
to allow bad surveillance to whether on the fine
if you don't like the slowgan
you have a problem with it
it all seriousness
but it has established the infrastructure of a police state and it could be open to abuse in the
i have nothing to hide
better street lighting can help
the next generation
i'm not jeremy fine
standing in for your regular host for one weeat tonally
and what's the privilege that is
if you're watching
that's all for this week
notsur great
across 95 miles
're floating hotel
but before that
i can't believe it
in a form of a dessert plate
regarding one of britain's most noted
that makes a grand total of six
in a modern house
without first do
the perfect pite
anything could happen
they're all about the same
we have run out of time
theease and kke lvin
now they are gathering
all life and the arctic
could we arrange that
i was fine yesterday
let's not miss about
what i can tell you
this is south well
the romans felt that their presence was strong enough here
the sa to king
when he was at sta at palace
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
literally two minutes from the airport
maybe more of still and
which melts more highse
think about the melting sea ice
againe open to the elements
very attractive young woman
and that has an important effect
provided by the railways
the great thing about the railways is
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
there is one thing
it might beam on for night
of course it will
today's contestants are
thanks for watching
i feel guilty when i'm at home
i will always need you
thank you very much
as you might say that
but mike goodness
also known as a tandum
so i think it is a piece of very one dimensional left wind propaganda
there is some huge cross over between the two
tax credits are basically benefits
formerly known simons
i feel like this
because that's how you are a part of society
before i came out
or morecorrectly council
especially as it relates to children
they are children
i do hope you'll join us then
islam announs pl than me
if you haven't caughted yet
her self currying insight
some people here tonight prefer subtitles
surely as a matter of principle
if you're watching
standard rght supply
has a time flow
in the meantime
when my husband and i are not around
asking for permission
and it was totally nomal
that sounds like a pretty crazy job for anyone to be doing
all my fingers were hanging off
i went into my right arm
he was shot and killed
if i didn't have h
but at the same time
i'm with marked twain lies
it's the internet
and i'm warning you
in the basement
they haven't gone fat
time now for one of the greatest tv come backs off our time
harolds in neighbours
we need to start layering
one was the pilot
surrender was not an option
many were teenagers about to get their first taste of wark
i'm karb sorry
he died that very first day
this is one of the questions
celebrating 100 years of war films
where i'm going
but en years ago
it could end tonight
back in sierra leone
and this wasn't unusual
as well as the body
giving hope and care to others to something our armed forces do without question
we heard the story of the nurse and across
to have no contact at all
she needs to make sure that
they don't call them toan pocket rocket for nothing
you've probably got yours
and the weather has been perfect
colouredge under fire
most of his life
this is the lordushcraft gallery
trapped under heavy artillary fire

as we approach remembrance sunday
i've been involved with the miniaturey
the armed forces
that knock on the door is a moment they will never forget
who was killed in afghanistan
on a routine visit to an iraqi police station

so what is the etett
which is a shame
between them now
i havent had my fitting now
mr kh' speaking

i don't really want to go
rising above it
the olympics mer
i wish i was more like you
why don't we all just get along
a tible nation
we j upset some of our female rendids
thanks for watching
porter recent style
it was really nice
you won't have a lotg
on this remembrance weekend
an opportunity to pay tribute to all members of the armed forces
if you've got it
we would love to sell it
we would love to see you
only seven places were madin
like many others
great and lenonard coin
i love weddings
i've got a better idea
why don't we all objecked
that was amazing
it was an incredible performance
it was incredible entertainment
up in the last week
the man takes the lead
it's time now for everything in between
i really appreciate it
it's all based on this 58 page report prepared for the european commission
but when you're look inside
they get lost on the way home
and you've got every right p
having said that
that was fast and furious
done and dusted
that's not an ancient roman mask
he's japanese made
which you lot of them where
our journey is and over yet
and it's not just any old toesay
who knew that one man
but it might be too late by that
ion't think so
from what we know
thank you very much
graham baron hash
and they were the first people
earlier this month
he was prettiant
furniture objects like that
it was made in germany
no one would look twice
and i'm pretty sure his push bike came in very handy
they were so inspired playing
check the details on our website
learn as much as possible
keeps going on about this
i do nothing wrong
there's so many thinks
this is where the surprises happen
it's time to return to wolverhampton
they decided to tie the knot
everywhere you go around here
we have some u finished basiness to do in the auction room
we have gone digital
and after reaching out him on the show
run for cover if you can
they are under a lot of stress
with that in mind
welcome to the tower
was it your choice
you really feel a part of it
it's so wonderful to see that
talking about this
for me it doesn't make sense
if we have a belief in reencarnation
even though her father at that time disagree
so when the body is brought back
my first granddiughter
non vviolent defences
there are a lot of people
around the world
but i come across training prisoners out
've look at the cost of this failure
the obvious cost of keeping a person in prison is 36
the most famous of them all have to be the works for bronte sisters
in terms of fire service resources
rather newing drugs
that's good news
the big question is
a view orld the yours yes
but these are one of the most rarey birds in the world
that's not what i was expecting at all
i love cedabore
and you know what this means
we might find some maritime memorabilia
it's a wonderful
stocks and shares
and in the process of meing not offending god
i don't care what the cost is
because the whole point of 911 is that it's s just justification for the police state
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've hadd
and it's all about the context
charlie for millennia
two appointments later
the man who cares about animals
guess what i'm talking about right now
here to give us a rundown of the greatest facial choreogphy ever seen on the box

the duke of gloucester
and you know that
we have the delectable neil jones
but don't worry
that was some time agoin
real friends that care about me
clearly they do
you don't need it
the reason being
the president chair
not to think for themselves
that is our first
with my blessing
that's the message from independent economists after the chanceor's autumn statements
and with that in mind
his father died
not just helear and nothingh i'm sure
but it seems depending to see everyone's personal taste
it's time to find out if nigel
remember that man with the camera
and you can follow us
thanks for watching
put his not door bacws
i do know what it means
when i found out
after all i've been through
i want to talk about atedtitude
everybody was blown away
we still have all of this to come
i want to take her selfie
rescuing a damseill and distress
all of that can change
but what exactly is it
how does it work
there's always historical treasures look at
fast and furious
later inturn
later on in life
they moved around a lot
as it's the title of this poem
four kilometres without even really thinking about it
in the highway code itself
so in the meantime
through antibody corrective therapies
and i feel very
i'm not diybing cowbar
for some reason
i just can't seem to win
it would be a brilliant success
he retrieved the flag
i'm struggling with that one
he's a nutzing sensation
born into a family of dancers
i made a few calls
as well as the green man
this is extremely rare and valuable
not for subject matter
i hasen to aed
here on the day
but i felt he was exposed
are youing him

and the champagne
before we bring on our next contender
if you have a question for either of them
so to do ballroom
i am the ultimate power
it is the cquterfinals
we had a blazing
when he retired
the family seat
please welcome jenniy acleare

they have no idea what to expect
two and a half minutes of that round
so let's get on with it
thanks for watching
i'm not satisfied
it's on our table package
when we see him
want me to be happy
what season was that
don food left out
i' mis you at the party
quly the world
i'm really looking forward to this
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiquaries
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand what of these monuments in a modern
and people live in
it's about the day
a purification ceremony
it's so much an all person
and this might be
every single person
that's the best kind of teaching
i had a great time
that's what child support services does
nicola is definitely the love of my life
she is my judyet
the shelt to my marvin
i guess i'm afraid
i like spending time with him
and it is a service
she's got the best top line in the business
so i don't know
that's what you said
it is just a name
i've been wort
talk smart
my little boy is
that seems to me like a pretty impressive perk of the job by anybody's standards
we bought the firm packs
enjoy the money
embossed leather wallpaper
i'm getting older
i'll be popping in the achieving
join me tomorrow
but she's not confused
you need to be strong up here
make sure you never get a press again
with billing up be in yours
when it comes to designing fabulous costumes
their are battlings be ground pro challenge champion
the prime minister slaps him down
how big is that
separated from that
coming in on the other side
what did you put in the mild rine
it's a terrible idea
and they don't make big money
everywhere you look
to really make my day
and we have today
men wantt be him
he absolutely insisted on writing his own intro
we have family and friends
it's all about the strictly prootallenge
but before we can go any further
the six highest scoring runners will alify
thanks for watching
just before christmas
that's it for the reds
i think she's completely bonkers
you are dynamic
it was full of content
aslam would sake
it's actually a sulsa
the garden of england
you can get a better structure
every year since christmas began
way you back in the early
i actually wanted to be called
usually a bicycle
through the accessibility to those children
like most other forms of modern warfare
you do love your toge
they were innocent anch army
you want to look
or is it that you enjoy those toys and it makes you into a different person
space was still the final frontier
it looks really like it is
when i get home
the ball shaped one
you see that present
to what he did to get round that
but in those case
it becomes a fire engine
four little turcles named after italian renaissance artists
some burn brightly for a year or two
if you didn't have one
what was all that about
already in the statkes
the right place
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
sausages in bacon
christmas pudding that nobody really likes
stick some james bond on
that someone was going to get
you can't read the same
got in front of the whole family
you unfold the board
at the same time
in victorian britain
on the orders of queen victoria
i think he's perfect
when it comes to toys
maybe not the uranium
but i like to seek it
we like to rub a nises
for that reason
this really makes this thing
maybe there's an extensive packn
when the archaeolg just got to work
i'm trying not to get carried away
it really was that bad
but they will not do
let's take a look behind the thingenes how it all came
time now for our next guest
over the last 12 years
why show me this
i'm on the case
even christmas day
but toward the end
he has not held back anything
but it was so disconcertaingly calm in the studio
here's reveal the secret to getting your hands on the trophy
i shouldn't sayke those things
what else can i be
not well dressed
she is married now
best and happiest of all
the time before him was his own
that's what i am
it sounds very good
she's deressed about daddy
and you listen to me
i'm still surrounded by hundreds of people
all the information will be there
every week he comes down
i'm the rivering all that
leave that to me
but from all that
i'd like to help you
i don't want you to say
which is incredible
i had no idea how much
but at the same time
so let's find out who that will be
some recent scores
thanks for watching
the perfect house
the perfect family
and as a result
the first muslim woman deserves a cabinet minister
it's not the middle ages
he doesn't hold me
so please welcome
it was actually extremely well placed
lease don't try to vote if you're watching on to mar
attention and emotion
and it's perfect for tonight
can they improve on that score and possibly run away with the trophy
that was within budget
for the audience at home
the rise have made
proper street frud is great
you don't have to be a celebrity
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
if you can have sex

thanks for watching
fraame and fortune
i'm not afraid of being a challenged
there's no wrong way
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
in this case a flower
as animals are preparing for the winter
but there's a problem
cheath and steal from one another to get themselves to decent meill
it seemed to be
i do mrs a little bit
this is all you
before you know it
you go to bed with it
and your family and your kids and your other jobs
that was amazing
the long youday in
because you worked so hard
if it go wrong
go about telling him that
for good reasons and bad reasons
if they start from here
obsessed through this show
if i had my way
if we have a litcle atome
so when he gets grumpiats likeh
let's say for example
i'm sure you could imagine
see is hysterical
and when i want to keep
very high level
going all over the world
people are happy to be there and good vibe
everywhere you turn
because they've got towo
just working with him every week is such a treat
which was quite amusing
that's a pickleed warn up
you have to go and buy biscuits
you wasted your time
they all came and went
it didn't survive
sos would be
right on the front
in his country
tick to the fish world war
she never let on
so you know who he really is
so please welcome
this could be a first class routine
everyone on the show really
with white christmas
i've been on my own
although i can't imagine why
because i just want to help
the let's face it
project management is re my specialist area
to be completely honest
the sheer size and power can be intimidating
but there was even better news
represented by this bunch of bananas
it's down to wild brain and getting things wrong
he was about to find out
the forces of nature separate outs
neutrons and electrons
but when you open the box
that's not right
in this universe
and it might seem ridiculous
12 miles in dimetur
sretching back 3
staggering on the edge of space
pondering the immensity
we live in a tiny
thanks for watching
you think i didist
it's all about rarity
as opposed to chinese
but i couldn't believe it would be true
if you've got a good story
and a man who made the discovery
but everyone going into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellious socks
don't forget that scarecrow
maybe somewhere nice and safe
i'm not sure what's the most oful thing to get right
gardens never finished
should never be put off
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify rolls
there are times i like to listen to bananrama
and yet that and fish and chips
this just calm down
the dage justs got weirder and weirder
back to the history books
it's practically a vegetarian
how does the plant attract the bat
the bad benefits
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertement which says
this is the best bat hotel in town
that's why i get up in the morning
two minutes on general knowledge
h in the clar of the spotlight
so why did you do before
that you have to go
and she was being interviwed by the american journalists
he alwso lies this
we did a different version of things and
and then turned to me and said
i hadn't thought that
that would be fantastic
play much in bol pen
every two weeks
that's what they do
before we begin
and on this fateful evening
what's your name
i don't believe in fairies
then we must rescu her
and with stunth
he made a move on me
we've not discussed it
and we run love
how do i choose this
we've got 24 characters
following those words
i think you deserve
a striking contrast
very similar to fish it
he's like looking at art
it might be conceptual
thanks for watching
here's some ideas
a place which is hard to leave
and the farmers open e it up
so when the farmers come
there's more woodlands
i don't tell anyone
we have to no mold money
we are the comminance
notobswuicide bumbers
that's according to the police watchdog
the queen mary and queenlizabeth
it's design values
theywd a minority
500 tones with ocean liner
one of the articles here is about the queen elizabeth
the job h done
thanks for watching
flowers and even vegetables
for something completely different
when it comes to publicity
how vra is the
i just loved that
they were friends
tell me about it
until next time
to be a successful entrepreneur
i just don't get it
and i think this is one
something like that
with corrupt governments
because of the small size
it'll mean more matches
and more money for favour
pleased with himself
as servia is pandemonium let loose
there are no recordings ofloyd george at the peak of his powers
which was the mass newspaper
and he was very devoted to his children
and would havementually marry her after his wife
without flourish
what you need to do is get the very best brains
the very best talents
the most energetic people in
because the empire
it's often for tht
which is absolutely understandable
he hoped to return to power
could not be a happy place
dependent on trade
my great great grandfather
much more driven
if it gives me some sort of control back
wh ston wines
i can remember that happening before
by some miracle
that's very good
comes from one of the most beautiful parts of the world
it's got a massive summer money
they love architecture
dragling or wrongly
i wouldn't say i' i'm a star
menter ni fans
thanks for watching
set up by the government
it was a brutal experience
many people did slip and fall and break alike
they kept living
and in the morning
it exactly said
and the second generation
been intensely sad
and all the survives of the holocaust
with their dates based
get a new loyal customer and debenhams
as long as they see the spark of success
from a stone circle here
during the summer months
that is a sold sound we
there's plenty to indulge it
she was struggling
when he went to look for her
whatever it was
25 years to complete
she will be very pleas
because there was no ro role moot of
one male official commented
but despite all this
they carried on competing
but despite all the
if you want to experience some of that
go wast in your time
including a baby
this is a semifinal
i'm sorry that doesn't meet with your approovis
i'm not having the go i do
i'm just saying that didnys brought me up
we had no money
when you came back
that's why i'm losing my voice
is in the drying
right in front of me
we talked about it
i honestly don't know what to do
and i do mean hundreds
i don't mind this one
and just between you and me
judging by what i saw today
some got what they want
get down to your local one
have you got it
but i promise you
you better stay well away from me
that i'll be ok
thousands of pounds
we need to do something bigger
trying to bring them down over the centuries
but you don't need to worry
the experts don't know what caused it
the father diad five years ago
and things like that
it's all about myth making
comome to my room
as the morning spread upon the mountains
with people without creating
but other people
and the initial stand for the international marxists group
as you may know
this came from the big
i probably would
good that's really sad
i need to get to work
before i announce the winner
we need to find out is there a problem
we don't have brown bear
if you'ters know
we may enjoy the thrill of more regular sightings
what their aspirations are
without the tyal lag
very heavily taxed
and it's scottish customers to buy
and it was but accpy in public subscption
today almost 50
the government looked set to win
which the norwegian government was supporting
a rather special
you should think about it
good luck with that
we found out about the suffold bunch horses
but it's a different type of animal i want to show you right now
things like this became very
the quality of that sliding across
and that's what it's all about
join us next time for many more surprises
so is that the other
we don't tlip it for the money
i don't really mind
a new chance of life
but i'm not sure where
it's higher than before
but another strike in union
there was a glmer of hoppe
more open mind perhaps
and more open to the parliament
to revivee the room into two parts
the invitation
he was halfway there
partw was the declaration of rights
they say that that the king may not raise taxation without the consent of parliament
it was the battle ofborne
i love the same
it makes them sound like an action film
which of course
the shard of mustkard
it's here to stay
you've had them top day
i think he will
very happy in days
so at one point
we do nothing about making cheese
and i suppose the bottom liners if you want are thriving
put it that way
costing nearly 1 million
and's getting rid of it
thanks for watching
and the top end of 15 to 18
once those nift doors open
to the potential investor
just like my personality
i know it quite well
and for that reason
i want to be in the holding company
i'm really sorry
good luck to him and the elusive michael beckett in their new dragon partnership
whatever they decide to call the company
that's the holy grail
if you build it
very fine and deep
it separates yorkshire from lincolnshire
hoping to make a fortune at auction
after having spent 10 years himself in exile
in the eyes of some
a waiting call marh
robel was falling back
she informed me
you're an idiot
it's just a wee village
the fishing villages on the north east coast
someone you have to book
i would say probably about 25
it's still going up
with the price of gold
and it's a beautiful place
doesn't mean say that we get home with everybody
from time to time
he still wanted
we both want to be here
i really missed the island
regardless what happens
i've just got back
finding the right path is not always easy
there is so much on over the weekend
and on stand it 12
what's the best thing about the royal highland show
we want to know what you think
a companyeve
george skinner is with me
where's the horns
we need some antiques
don't you think
the wonderful discovery of wicche
and our experts
while we make our wedding to the coastline
the main concern
there was a boy
human representations can be offensive to muslims
i would like to help
thanks for watching
in the long term
the guilt would go
but he wouldn't listen
i don't think so
the work was hard
not part of our glory
the operation would go ahead
out or whatever it was
i know how hard you want
i can't take much more of this
this is very important
we need to be a team
you see these animals
to speed things up
you're all the same
while we've been away
came up with the perfect name
it's an amazing place
but that's all changing
going under the hammer right now
i think rather embarrassed
if we don't like it
heston is here to help you
something is going to work out for me
with climate change
that's a big attraction
very soon after taking off
anything can happen
let's go inside
that was exciting
most of the recovered pieces were lost
i'm absolutely in love with this
i don't think so
that was going to be my next assumption
and it's a strange
so it's an inspiration
where are the more dives
on the same proportion
it's become so fragmented
let's put those valuations to the test
he made the superstructure
we would love to see you
we still have hundreds of people waiting to see our experts
but i thought it was a bit depressing
would you be happy
and i went to the museum in isleyton
i need a close the restaurant
the price of property
i can't put it any planeersn' that
for the bst part
on the other nine
which is relatively small by scottish standards
and i really hope
you are out of it
over the next few weeks
for whatever reason
it can be quite daunting
a revolution is taking place
we worked together when we were starting out
i don't want to
it is a battle that needs to be fought
we were flabr gastid
the dean today liames of tenants
it's such a meindish responsibility
when you're away from it
the job sescription of the farmer's wives
thanks for watching
a very popular tourist destination
also very good for any straanth
but' ready to do reason
what do you thin
which explains
is some 200 years later
this whole area will still be in the safe act
everyone has gone home happy and that's what it's all about
and itd be like
this is my revenage
and it may well be
there aren't any biscuits in that barrel
i didn't mean you
that would just make things worse
when my father had died
for the next two minutes
the way the market is
the wring leader of the gunpowder plot
all hoping the king would for
these laws would remain in place for over 200 years
as a result of the compound blot
it may take some time
you know most of it
so i'll ask you again
