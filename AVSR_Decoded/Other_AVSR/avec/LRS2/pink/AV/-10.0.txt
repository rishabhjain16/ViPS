we're just about getway with it n
god compos
it's not all about
and if you want wonderful
it' starting with the compost
for the brief time
they w change lives
w my husband andid i knock round
butle do it now
don't forget me
things in my words
it would have been completely gal to the rest of lond
but i think what was of the blue bit
popular
instead of it was to
i expect to have a p
cammaome to
i paid the money
the course of his love
when you finished
but before i do
this house would just come together and flourished
any man will be proud to have cse

get himr garden
this' one is tot out control
p up to cot
it's part of the natural garden team
i' bored
what better first flor flat
if you're going to be ingreased
but it's sid
i'm notpassively happy
if you areking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for subotential house so well
done on time and the right money
but what's surprised when you come in
it's fantastic
what do you think about that
look
it's l eas it looks
what you at
that is important
but it's a really well
i knew what i used to do what i was in the boy
i'm starting tom offe you for night night department
i couldn't wait it
except lau at
you never know by the end of the bid
i know it comes with planning permission
but we improve on a green roof
we've got a graat relationship
what is the ku
somembers the public don't understand it' goold
if you left in the building
new namees everywhere every night
but i think it's really really important property lessons
good cction
you have told youror
who's f prarticul family history
i w spnd more
dead it won't be
think something dressing needs to be done
what do you p about
i'm writing to say that
as best
so let's go back and find out
very impressed
the best p is
not quite high
that's the bir point
on the face of it
the first se floor flat
as you recign of smoking
we'll give it a cry
go to the pice
the groups
eight fe tall
and the really for that
a little sen frst
wherever you are
mayb a mition compa that
i brought them in next spot
sometimes a cut
i think it looks right
it's a quite large gift
and it's a great way to eat
that first peing
but no we have these viruses
swit or box fiers
csoum
but not for me to farming
is' that simple
that's really deouf d
it's a long way from home
and you end rare part ofo
lots of thingeds to think about
i'm so happy
who must have a personal
we were looking together
it would be a great investment
or property just say
bring it on the outside
because there was offices
very close by the university
grand father flat
i would market that
this day on
f this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartmentnd there at a moment
probably around 55
and she's the convertion
really value work
she was a flor trip
given him a footha to the water
visiting on which all part of the impact
from small chips
as she would
sometimes it's difficult where
if you were to block pla
i'll be wareing for me
it's a very good ldition
it's different amount of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it about you think
i would do that
destroy the property
ch
they struggling or are they fst with theay
it is my bit
we plant a pand together
offter a coupble of fli
any cool comicble fu

with one of the rooms upset

this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
can' be quite expensive
it's a multing contort
on the face of it
buying a new build property should have any wor to
s with potential stamp
great place for him to be
we have to paid for that
so rather th rely information
