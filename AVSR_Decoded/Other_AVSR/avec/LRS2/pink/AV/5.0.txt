and for me the surprise was
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next day
when there isn't much else in the garden
so you've second half of october
well inter november
we can just about get away with it now
something like a garden compost
it's not all about stars
and if you want wonderful
starting with the compost
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
please donate now
don't forget me
these are my words
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we'll see here is kind of the blue piece
he was so popular
instead of being someone's arm kentteer
i expect you to have a post
see how much it comes to
i pay the money
for the cause of his life
when it's finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any man would be proud to have you was a son
at the end of the tide
get them into the garden
this one is totally out of control
but it comes and goats
it's part of the nationural garden scheme
i think it's brong
a one bedroom first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm not massively happy
if you are looking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what is surprise when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not as easy as it looks
sticks to what you're good at
that is important
but he did really well
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
i couldn't read it
except as a last resaur
you never know by the end of the bill
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some members of the public don't quite understand leasehold
if you lived in the building
would you want new neighbours every week or every fortnight
but i think he's already learned some really important property lessons
choosing a good location
you have to hold your nerve
whos very much into family history
we don't want to spend more than
it's deinly one be
i think something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm right in saying that
time has passed
so let's go back and find out
i'm very impressed
the best bargains
not quite as high
it's a blus point
on the face of it
the first and second floor flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give it a try
go to the press
learning the ropes
eight feet tall
and the reason for that
a little saxopf us
wherever you are
it may be a miniature compared to that
i can plant them in that spot
sometimes it doesn't
i think it looks great
that's quite a large leaf
and it's a great way to eat it
that first meeting
but no we have these viruses
squirrel pox fires
causes in your harm
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is the tale of two cities
it's a long way from home
as you enter the rare part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm too happy
who must have a personal key
we will own it together
it will be a great investment
or properties should i say
pretty on the outside
because it was offices
very close by the university
ground floor flats
i would market that
add another ten on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment's around here at the moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
realistic value wise
she was a flowhip
even before she entered the water
visiting on whicst all parts of the empire
from small ships
as a touth she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you intend to bid on a place
it's hard to come away from it
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroying the property
purely by chance
they struggling or are they flushed with success
he is my builder
we played a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic book villain
and then of course
desperate to prove your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the prevailing wins
searching for ancers
we know what they are
there's no obvious reason
taking horticulture to the exxt freme
the whole gardens are extraordinary and
like hundreds of thousands of people do every y
but now there's more potectiional
about 20 years ago
and a couple of weeks ago
enjoy the summer
are they relatives of yours
not just a hotel
but the war of the stora
they will be able to go back
not just a hotel
not just in this town
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his vantage point
there is nowhere so there is no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new build property should mean you don't have any work to do
some issues with potential damp
a great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just relying on this information
all of the brain is combining all the different senses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open plant area is definitely the way to go
travel three miles furth the west and you do get more for your money here
if that was fitted down
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be above par
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
things like that will do ourselves
this auction lot has it in spain
if you can't go up
it's cosmetically improved quite drastically here
on the second floor
it's very clean
the appliances have been done nicely
it could be your passport to a small fortune
in other words made the base
garage and techno funk
ando novemma
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spree
over the last two weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel the world
here in this greenhouse and the other world
as long as you'll calm
is it all good news
why are many supermarkets stopping selling cage eggs
free range goods
to make it work
very few remain
taking it all in
one northern welh ruer
for the first time
formally aledged his title at the prince of wales
and here on top of the eagle tower
it wash just now incidillia
according to legends
it was a blank canvas
in the first year alone
as she lay dying
the garrison responded with a hail of arrows
and when you're moving through enemy territory
the garrison tried to surrender before he could try out his new toy
he ordered them back inside
you don't deserve my grace
taking no chances
tearing into the ground
according to legend
there was a port colours
people sat on the stairs
which is ideal for it
cracks will appear
someone came out of neighbouring property and said
very expensive shed
without my son lasses
even the foreplay
and then when it came to his signature
it's a baking show
she's pushed herselfes
it sounds wrong
what have you learned
children and adults are like
that's a shocking percentage
i'm just hopeful
we have a less atmosphere above us
no longer would measurement be based on the human body
no longer dependent on the sun
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks to watching
our continued pressure
an inflammatory photograph
inflammatory or terrible images
we have to look at how saudi arabia
in terms of britain
to the average person
thereays a firtonce you will be
about t2 million
when it comes to the issue of equal marriage
to allow bad surveillans to whether on the vine
if you don't like the slowgan
you have a problem with it
in all seriousness
but it has established the infrastructure of a police state and it could be open to abuse in the
i have nothing to hide
better street lighting can help
the next generation
i'm not jeremy fine
standing in for your regular host for one week coly
and what a privilege that is
if you're watching
that's all for this week
don't you a great
across 95 miles
their're floating hotel
but before that
i can't believe it
in a form of a dessert plate
regarding one of britain's most noted
that makes a grand total of six
in a modern house
without further redo
the perfect pite
anything could happen
they're all about the same
we have run out of time
louise and kevin
now they are gathering
all life in the arctic
cos we arrange that
i was fine yesterday
let's not miss about
what i can tell you
this is sound well
the romans felt their presence was strong enough here
to say to the king
when he was staying at the palace
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
literally two minutes from the airport
maybe more of still and
which melts more ice
think about the melting sea ice
togain open to the elements
very attractive young woman
and that has an important effect
provided by the railways
the great thing about the railways is
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
there is one thingat
it might be bom for a night
of course it will
today's contestants are
thanks for watching
i feel guilty when i'm at home
i will always need you
thank you very much
as you might say
but my goodness
also known as a tanzum
so i think it is a piece of very one dimensional left wind propaganda
there is some huge cross over between the two
tax credits are basically benefits
formerly known as simons
i feel like this
because that's how you are a part of society
before i came out
or more correctly councils
especially as it relates to children
who they are children
i do hope you'ill join us then
it's not my an hounse b than me
if you haven't caught it the end
herself currentlyer inside
some people here tonight be fir subtitles
surely as a matter of principle
if you're watching
standard race supply
has a time flow
in the meantime
when my husband and i are not around
asking for permission
and it was totally normal
that sounds like a pretty crazy job for anyone to be doing
all my fingers were hanging off
i went to use my right arm
he was shot and killed
if i didn't have her
but at the same time
i'm a marked twain lies
it's the internet
and i'm warning you
in the basement
they haven't gone father
time now for one of the greatest tv comebacks of our time
harolds in neighbours
we need to start layering
one was the pilot
surrender was not an option
many were teenagers about to get their first taste of wark
i'm terribly sorry
he died that very first day
this is one of the questions
celebrating 100 years of war films
where i'm going
but en years ago
it could end tonight
back in sierra leone
and this wasn't unusual
as well as the body
giving hope and care to others is something our armed forcedes to do without question
we heard the story of the nurse and across
to have no contact at all
she needs to make sure that
they don't call them team pocket rocket for nothing
you've probably got yours
and the weather has been perfect
colourage under fire
most of his life
this is the lorushcroft gallery
trapped under heavy artillery fire
ten days beforehand
the president elect has met with president obama
mr trum takes office in january
today they talked about the process of transition
we have all the usual suspects
anywhere in the world
demonstrates the value of green space
ten cubic matres
i just collapse
as we approach remembrance sunday
i've been involved with the military
the armed forces
that knock on the door is a moment they will never forget
who was killed in afghanistan
on a routine visit to an iraqi police station
are killing him and five friends
it won't take a moment
so what is the etiquette
which is a shame
between them now
i haven't had my fitting now
mr khan speaking
if we have learned one thing over the past year
i don't really want to go
rising above it
the olympics swimmer
i wish i was more like you
why don't we all just get a along
a tribal nation
which upset some of our female residents
thanks for watching
p orter rercent style
it was really nice
you won't have long
on this remembrance weekend
an opportunity to pay tribute to all members of the armed forces
if you've got it
we would love to sell it
we would love to see you
only seven places remain
like many others
rate lenonar and cohin
i love weddings
i've got a back an idea
why don't we all objecked
that was amazing
it was an incredible performance
it was incredible entertainment
up until last week
the man takes the lead
it's time now for everything in between
i really appreciate it
it's all based on this 58 page report prepared for the european commission
but when you look inside
they get lost on the way home
and you've got every right to be
having said that
that was fast and furious
done and dust
that's not an ancient roman mask
he's japanese made
which a lot of them were
our journey is and over yet
and it's not just any orld tuesday
who knew that one man
but it might be too late by that
i don't think so
from what we know
thank you very much
graham baron hash
and they were the first people
earlier this month
he was brilliant
furniture objects like that
it was made in germany
no one would look twice
and i'm pretty sure his push bike came in very handy
they were so inspired by it
check the details on our website
learn as much as possible
keep going on about this
i do nothing wrong
you sob whaty thinks
this is where the surprises happen
it's time to return to wolverhampton
they decided to tie the knot
everywhere you go around here
we have some unfinished business to do in the auction room
we have gone digital
and after reaching out to him on the show
run for cover if you can
they are under a lot of stress
with that in mind
welcome to the tower
was it your choice
you really feel a part of it
so wonderful to see that
talking about this
for me it doesn't make sense
if we have a belief in recarnation
even though her father at that time disagree
so when the body is brought back
my first grand older
nonviolent defences
there are a lot of people
around the world
but i come across training prisonsw
' look at the cost of this failure
the average cost of keeping a person in prison is 36
the most famous of them all have to be the works for bronte sisters
in terms of fire service resources
rather than using drugs
that's good news
the big question is
have you ordered yours yes
but these are one of the most rarey birds in the world
that's not what i was expecting at all
i love cedaal
and you know what this means
we might find some paritigim memorabilia
it's a wonderful
stocks and shares
and in the process of me not offending god
i don't care what the cost is
because the whole point of 911 is that it's the justification for the police state
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've hadd
and it's all about the context
child of the millennium
two appointments later
the man who cares about animals
guess what i'm talking about right now
here to give us a rundown of the greatest facial choreography ever seen on the box
face to really tell story
get yourself over here because first up tonight
if you want to know what the kids are listening to these days
louise and kevin
and it's the one that
that was beautiful
on international women's day
and went on the ordinary win
the duke of gloucester
and you know that
we have the delectable neil jones
but don't worry
that was some time ago
real friends that care about me
clearly they do
you don't need it
the reason being
the president's chair
not to think for themselves
that is our first
with my blessing
that's the message from independent honommist after the chancellor's autumn statement
and with that in mind
his father died
not just heven noting i'm sure
but it seems dependent as to everyone's personal taste
it's time to find out if nigel
remember that man with the camera
and you can follow us
thanks for watching
but it's not all badck news
i do know what it means
when i found out
after all i've been through
i want to talk about daddy to
everybody was blown away
we still have all of this to come
i want to take yourselfie
rescuing a dampseal in distress
all of that to change
but what exactly is it
how does it work
there's always historical treasures to look at
fast and furious
later in turn
later on in life
he moved around a lot
as it's the title of this poem
four kilometres without even really thinking about it
in the highway code itself
so in the meantime
through antibody corrected therapy
when i feel very
i'm your simon coweron
for some reason
i just can't seem to win
it will be a brilliant success
he retreat the flag
i'm struggling with that one
he's a latin sensation
born into a family of dancers
i made a few calls
as well as the green man
this is extremely rare and valuable
not for subject matter
i hasten to add
here on the day
but i felt he was exposed
you and him
will appear in court next month
and the champagne
before we bring on our next contender
if you'veot a question for either of them
so to do ballroom
i am the ultimate power
it is the carter finals
we had a blazing
when he retired
the family seat
please welcome jennie echlea
it's a movie themam

two and a half minutes for that round
so let's get on with it
thanks for watching
i'm not tatisfied
it's on our tap package
when we see him
want me to be happy
what season was that
no food left out
i'll meet you at the party
probably in the world
i'm really looking forward to this
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiquarians
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand one of these monuments in a modern
and people live in
it's about the days
a purification ceremony
it'sill much an oonld person
and this might be
every single persch
that's the best kind of teaching
i had a great time
that's what chanld support service does
nicoler is definitely the love of my life
she's my jutiyet
the  shelt to my malvin
i guess i'm afraid
and id spending time with him
and it is a service
she's got the best top line in the business
so i don't know
that's what you said
it is just a name
i've been worst
talk smart
my little boy is
that seems to me like a pretty impressive perk of the job by anybody's standards
we bought the firm packs
enjoy the money
embossed leather wallpaper
i'm getting older
i'll be popping in e achieving
join me tomorrow
but she's not confused
you need to be strong up here
make sure you never get the pressed again
with billing up be in yours
when it comes to designing fabulous costumes
they are battling to be grounded pro challenge champion
the prime minister slaps him down
how big is that
separated from that
coming in on the other side
what did you put in the mild wine
it's a terrible idea
and they don't make big money
everywhere you look
you really make my day
and we have today
men want to be him
he absolutely insisted on writing his own intro
we have family and friends
it's all about the strictly pro challenge
but before we can go any further
the six highest scoring runners will qualify
thanks for watching
just before christmas
that's it for the reds
i think she's completely bonkers
you are dynamic
it was full of content
adlen would tayke
it's actually a sulsa
the garden of england
you can get a better structure
every year since christmas began
way you back in the early
i actually wanted to be hallse
usually a bicycle
through the accessibility to those children
like most other forms of modern warfare
you do love your dooul
they were innocent and charming
you want to look
or is it that you enjoy those toys and it makes you into a different person
space was still the final frontier
it looks really like it is
when i get home
the ball shaped one
you see that present
so what he did to get round that
but in those days
it becomes a fire engine
four little turtles named after italian renaissance artists
so i'm burn brightly for a year or two
if you didn't have one
what was all that about
already in the states
the right place
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
sausages in bacon
christmas pudding that nobody really likes
stick some james bond on
that someone was going to get
you can't really say
got in front of the whole family
you unfold the board
at the same time
in victorian britain
on the orders of queen victoria
i think he is perfect
when it comes to toys
maybe not uranium
but i like to sek it
we like to remendish
for that reason
this really makes this thingk
maybe there's an extensive patern
when the archaeologist just got to work
i'm trying not to get carried away
it really was that bad
but they will not do
let's take a look behind the scenes at how it all came
time now for our next guest
over the last 12 years
why show me this
i'm on the case
eving christmas day
but towards the end
he has not held back anything
but it was so disconcertingly calm in the studio
here to reveal the secret to getting your hands on the trophy
i shouldn't say those things
what else can i be
not well dressed
she is married now
best andan happiest of all
the time before him was his own
that's what i am
it sounds very good
she's depressed about daddy
you listen to me
i'm still surrounded by hundreds of people
all the information will be there
every week he comes out
the riverine all that
leave that to me
but for all that
i'd like to help you
i don't want you to saye
which is incredible
i had no idea how much
but at the same time
so let's find out who that will be
some recent scores
thanks for watching
the perfect house
the perfect family
and as a result
the first muslim woman deserves a cabinet minister
it's not the middle ages
he doesn't hold me
so please welcome
it was actually extremely well placed
lease don't try to vote if you're watching on demand
attention and emotion
and it's perfect for tonight
can they improve on that score and possibly run away with the trophy
that was within budget
for the audience at home
the rise of mad
proper street food is great
you don't have to be a celebrity
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
if you can have sex
take us for the match
it's not a goody
thanks for watching
fraame and fortune
i'm not afraid of being challenged
there's no wrong way
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
in this case a flower
as animals are preparing for the winter
but there's a problem
cheat and steal from one another to get themselves a decent mill
it seemed to be
i do mrs a little bit
this is all you
before you know it
you go to bed with it
and your family and your kids and your other jobs
that was amazing
the lotg you stay in
because you work so hard
if you go wrong
go about telling him that
for good reasons and badd reasons
if they start from here
obsessed with this show
if i had my way
if we have a little argument
so when he gets grandpates like
let's say for example
i'm sure you can imagine
she is hysterical
and when i was a keid
very high level
going all over the world
people are happy to be there and it's a good vibe
everywhere you turn
because they've got to
just working with him every week is such a treat
which was quite amusing
that's a pickleed warn up
you have to go and buy biscuits
you wasted your time
they all came and went to
it didn't survive
sales would be
right on the front
in his country
twice during the fish winer war
she never let on
so you know who he really is
so please welcome
this could be a first class routine
everyone on the show really
with white christmas
i being on my own
although i can't imagine why
because i just want to help
and let's face it
project management is really my specialist area
to be completely honest
the sheer size and power can be intimidating
but there was even better news
represented by this bunch of bonanas
it's down to wild brain getting things wrong
he was about to find out
the forces of nature separate outs
neutrons and electrons
but when you open the box
that's not right
in this universe
and it might seem ridiculous
12 miles in diameter
stretching back 3
staggering on the edge of space
pondering the immenseity
we live in a tiny
thanks for watching
you think i did this
it's all about rarity
as opposed to chinese
but i couldn't believe it would be true
if you've got a good story
and a man who made the discovered
but everyone going into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellious socks
don't forget that scarecrow
maybe do somewhere nice and safe
i'm not sure what' the most of yourul things get right
gardens never finish
she'll never be put off
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify roons
there are times i like to listen to bonaraama
and yet that and fish and chips
this'as calm down
the they just got weirder and weirder
back to the history books
it's practically a vegetarian
how does the plant attract the bat
the back benefits
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertisement which says
this is the best bat hotel town
that's why i get up in the morning
two minutes on general knowledge
h in the glare of the spotlight
so why did you do before
that you have to go
and she was being interviewed by the american journalists
he alwso lies this
we did a different version of things and
and then turned to me and said
i hadn't thought that
that would be fantastic
play by jimbol bent
every two weeks
that's what they do
before we begin
and on this fateful evening
what's your name
i don't believe in fairies
then we must rescue her
and with stunth
he made a move on me
we've not disgustsed it
and we run love
how do i choose this
we've got 24 characters
following those words
i think you deserve
a striking contrast
very similar to fishing
it's like looking at art
it might be conceptual
thanks for watching
the he's smudges
a place which is hard to live
and the farmers open e it up
so when the farm has come
there's more woodlands
got tell anyone
we have no mo money
we are the comrminance

that's according to the police watchdog
the queen mary and queen elizabeth
it's design values
they were in a minority
500 tonnes of ocean liner
one of the articles here is about the queen elizabeth
the job was done
thanks for watching
flowers and even vegetable
for something completely different
when it comes to publicity
how rae this
i just looked that
they were friends
tell me about it
until next time
to be a successful entrepreneur
and just don't get it
and i think this is one
something like that
with corrupt governments
because of the small size
itll bean more matches
and more money for favour
pleased with himself
servia is pandemonium let loose
there are no recordings of lloyd george at the peak of his powers
which was the mass newspaper
and he was very devoted to his children
and would eventually marry her after his wife
without flourish
what you need to do is get the very best brains
the very best talents
' the most engetic people in
because the empire
it's often forgotten
which is absolutely understandable
he hoped to return to power
would not be a happy place
dependent on trade
my great great grandfather
much more driven
if it gives me some sort of control back
with ston wins
i can't remember that happening before
by some miracle
that's very good
comes from one of the most beautiful parts of the world
it's notot a massive summer money
they love architecture
draanling or wrongly
i wouldn't say i'm a star
men juste ni fans
thanks for watching
set up by the government
it was a brutal experience
many people did slip and fall and break al lake
they kept living
and in the morning
id' exactly tell
and the second generation
been intensely sad
and all the survives of the holocaust
with their dat base
get a new loyal customer and depenhams
as long as they see the spark of success
from a stone circle here
during the summer months
that is a sold sound we
there's plenty to indulge in
she was struggling
when he went to look for her
whenever it was
25 years to complete
she will be very pleased
because there was n role model of
one male official commentar
but despite all this
they carried on competing
but despite all this
if you want to experience some of that
you're wasting your time
including and baby
this is a semifinal
i'm sorry that doesn't meet with you approval
i'm not having the go at you
i'm just saying that denis' brought me up
we had no money
when you came back
that's why i'm losing my voice

right in front of me
we talked about it
i honestly don't know what to do
and i do mean hundreds
i don't mind this one
and just between you and me
judging by what i saw today
some got what they want
get down to your local one
have you got it
but i promise you
you better stay well away from me
that i'll be ok
thousands of pounds
we need to do something bigger
trying to bring them down over the centuries
but you don't need to worry
the experts don't know what callled did
the father diay five years ago
and things like that
it's all about myth making
come to my room
as the morning spread upon the mountains
with people without creating
when other people
and the initial stand for the international marksistter group
as do you may know
this came from the beach
i probably would
good that that's really sad
i need to get to work
before i announce the winner
we need to find out is there a problem
we don't have brown bear
if answers know
we may enjoy the thrill of more regular sightings
what their aspirations are
without a dialogue
very heavily tated
and the scottish customer should buy
and it was built to adly by public subcription
today almost 50
the government looked set to win
which the norwegian government was supporting
a rather special
you should think about it
good luck with that
we found out about the suffold punch horses
but it's a different type of animal i want to show you right
things like this became very
the quality of that sliding across
and that's what it's all about
join us next time for many more surprises
goes that the other
we don't clip it for the money
i don't really mind
a new chance at life
but i'm not sure where
it's higher than before
but another striking union
there was a glimmer of hoppe
more open minded perhaps
and more open to the parliament
to revise the room into two parts
the eat invitations
he was halfway there
partw is the declaration of rights
they say there that the king may not raise taxation without the consent of parliament
it was the battle of the porn
i love the same
it makes them sound like an action film
which of course
the shot of musket
it's here to stay
you've had them top day
i think it will
very happy in thingays
so at one point
we do nothing about making chanes
and i suppose the bottom liners if you want a thriving
put it that way
costing nearly 1 million
and's getting rid of it
thanks for watching
and the top end of 15 to 18
once those nift doors open
to the potential investor
just like my personality
i know it quite well
and for that reason
i want to be in the holding company
i'm really sorry
good luck to him and the elusive michael beckett in dennuse dragon partnership
whatever they decide to call the company
that's the holy grail
if you build it
very fine indeed
it separates yorkshire from lincolnshire
hoping to make a fortune at auction
after having spent 10 years himself in exile
in the eyes of some
a waiting court marsh
rbel was falling back
she informed me
you're an idiot
it's just a wee village
the fishing villages on the northeast coast
some you have to book
i would say probably about 25
it's still going up
with the price of gold
and it's a beautiful place
doesn't mean to say that we get on with everybody
from time to time
he still wanted
we both want to be here
i really messed the island
regardless what happens
i've just got back
finding the right path is not always easy
there is so much on over the weekend
and on sunday 12
what's the best thing about the royal highlands show
we want to know what you think
i can't believe
georgekinner is with me
where's the hornes
we need some antiques
don't you think
the wonderful discovery of which is
and our experts
while we make our way dow to the coastline
the main concern
there was a boy
human representations can be offensive to muslims
i would like to help
thanks for watching
in the long term
the guilt would go
but he wouldn't listen
i don't think so
the work was hard
not part of our glory
the operation would go ahead
or whatever it was
i know how hard you work
i can't take much more of this
this is very important
we need to be a team
you see these animalies
to speed things up
you're all the same
while we've been away
came up with the perfect name
it's an amazing place
but that's all chang it
going under the hammer right now
i feel rather embarrassed
if we don't like it
ceston is here to help you
something is going to work out for me
with climate change
that's a big attraction
very soon after taking off
anything can happen
let's go inside
that was exciting
most of the recovered pieces were lost
i'm absolutely in love with this
i don't think so
that was going to be my next assumption
and it's a strange
so it's an inspiration
where are the mal dives
on the same proportion
it's become so fragmented
let's put those valuations to the test
he made the superstructure
we would love to see you
we still have hundreds of people waiting to see our experts
but i thought it was a bit depressing
would you be happy
and i went to the museum in isleyton
i need to close the restaurant
the price of property
i can't put it in any planiners than that
for the most part
on the other hand
which is relatively small by scottish standards
and i really hope
you are out of it
over the next few weeks
for whatever reason
it can be quite dunting
a revolution is taking place
we worked together when we were starting out
i don't want to
it is a battle that needs to be fought
we were flambour gascing
the d today lives of tenants
it's su tremendous responsibility
when you're away from it
the job description of the farm' wives
thanks for watching
a very popular tourist destination
also very good for any strange
but ready to do reason
what do you think
which explains it
some 200 years later
this whole area will still be in safe haats
everyone has gone home happy and that's what it's all about
and he'd be like
this is my revenge
and it may well be
there aren't any biscuits in that barrel
i didn't mean you
that would just make things worse
when my father had died
for the next two minutes
the way the market is
the ringleeader of the gunpowder plot
all hoping the king would for
these laws would remain in place for over 200 years
as a result of the compound blot
it may take some time
you know most of it
so i'll ask you again
