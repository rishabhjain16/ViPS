# Pearson Correlations: ViPS and Other Metrics

This folder contains Pearson correlation analyses for the following metrics:
- ViPS (Weighted Phonetic Score)
- WER (Word Error Rate)
- CER (Character Error Rate)
- BERTScore (semantic similarity)
- Semantic Similarity (sentence transformer)

Correlations are computed for:
- AV (Audio-Visual) mode
- Video-only mode
- Two dataset sizes: 30 hours and 433 hours
- Two datasets: LRS2 and LRS3

This allows comparison of how well each metric correlates with human or reference scores across different modalities, dataset sizes, and datasets.
