WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MEASURE CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECTS REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU SAY
IS USING THE PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT SEA CELL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THE SAME WONDERFUL IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
BLOCKS HAVE NAMES
WILL YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
AND YOU LIKE MATCH
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERVIEW
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN HIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WE'RE GOING TO EAT THESE COWS
THAT MEANS FROM COMPANY
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL
IT'S NOT IN THIS REAL
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE OF GALLS
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED SENT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
WERE ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GETS THE ANGING GRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THIS THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO SAY 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE THESE FEASTS AND FAMINE CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TENSION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDY HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE SUNS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T DAY MAYBE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE MILLION PEOPLE
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUO TODAY
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATIONALISTIC
THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THAT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT'S IT TOO MUCH A LOT OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH THIS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTY
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE AMAZING GUYS
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THE FACES BROADCAST OUR EXPERIENCE
AND THEN AT 11 A CLOCK THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LIT ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WE'RE THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
WHO WAS RIGHT
I'M A PROFESSOR WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW SO LET ME WRONG
OF COURSE HE WAS
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUTRAGED PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
THIS IS COMPANY THAT WAS OUR
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP SIT IT OFF
I'M NOT A MILITARY BRIGHT
THEY SIGN IT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO THE FORM OF THE FENCE
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOOD STREAM
I WANT TO BE A SENSE OF FASCINATION
LET'S FIND A GOAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
SHE WANTS THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LIFE
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
HE MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU SAW IN HIM RAT
WE DON'T USE AUDIO WE DON'T USE FADIO
HOW ARE YOU
THE POINT YOU MIGHT GET ME OF HOME
I DIDN'T WANT TO
I SUDDENLY ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE SUGGESTS WHAT WE NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GETS TO DO THAT
THEY HAD HIS THE JACKPOT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND THE
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
TO SET THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORRIBLE THINGS
WHAT DO POLIO
LET'S HAVE THAT
THERE WAS A SOUTH UP BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THEM AND
IT HAS TO STOP
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY DO ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE ISSUING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY
AND THE RIGHT THING IS THAT YOU CAN SAY ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
HOW SAT ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
I'M FRUSTRATIONAL YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE IF YOU LIVE IN THE MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
SO WE ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH SHARING
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THIS WHERE GAME CHANGE REQUIRES YOU CAN PUT ALL OF THAT TEACHER
WHY DO YOU NEED NO WHERE YOU ARE EXACTLY WHAT CLIMATE IS
I HAVE TO THINK HERE OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENT THINGS
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS SPEAK TO THIS THE PAST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL WAYS THROUGH IT
IT'S SOMETHING WAS WRONG
IT'S GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAD TO CELEBRATE
HERE RECONCYLABLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE PLUS WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTENED TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WORKED
AND HERE'S WHERE I SAY
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT ARE CONTRADICTIONS
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB STYLE BE HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1000 800 ANOTHER FIXED PEOPLE SIZE
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT CRIMAL GROUP
DOES YOU WANT TO SEE THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE'S LAW TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL TELLS
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO IF THEY WON'T GO FOR A WALK THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T <unk>LG<unk>
SHE WOULD HIDE IN THE CLOSET
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU THOUGHT ITSELF DIE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR TALK IS GETTING
HIS NAME IS LANIAS AND HE'S A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
THROUGH THE PRESSURE IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE STUDENTS WILL BE STRESSED ACTIVATION
WILL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A BIT
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR OF TERROR
YOU DON'T GET CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS THAN
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BAD STORES
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAN REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE USE
THAT'S BAD <unk>LG<unk>
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S MOBILE POPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND IF WE THINK ABOUT THE BEST LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FOR ME QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNOW THAT THEY CAN HAPPEN TO A WORKFORCE
ATTACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
YOU WROTE THAT
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
THE KEY HERE REALLY IS KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DID AN EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU'VE JUST HAD A NEW THING SOMETIMES
AND MORE THEY WOULD LIKE WEEKS
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
IT'S SOMEONE'S BECOMING THE SEAT ACTS OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S THE SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD YOU
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IT'S NOT WORKING
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
SINCE YOU THE IDEAS ON MIND
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT SEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND IS THIS REALLY THE SOLUTION
SO I WANTED MY JOSH
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THESE THINGS THEY FADE AWAY TO BE
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS ALONES INVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 SENIOR OFFICIALS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF THIS
I'M SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD
THUS MORE EXPENSIVELY
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT TO STAND THE RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE GOING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY ARE WE SKIPPING OVER THIS
I WENT TO THE DEAN
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT'S LIKE ME THIS PROJECT
WE'VE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHAT STARTS IS OFTEN EXACTLY
IT'S THE PERFORMANCE FRIENDLY TRUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I HAVE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE MAGIC
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 EMAILS
WEBSITES
SO IT'S WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN'T FEEL
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHY OF RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW I'VE WRITTEN DOWN TO MY
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WHAT'S THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT
LET'S BE A STREET THIS
IT'S BAD DYING
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
WELL WE GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
SO WHAT IS AN IDEA DRAWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
YOU'RE ALL COLLECTIVE
AND IF YOU SEE PRETTY OKAY WHAT'S THE FIRST
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON'S PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
PLEASE TEN DEGREES BECAUSE THERE ARE
THERE'S LOVE AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND THEIRS PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENTS WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REALIZED IT'S IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
SHOULD WE EMERGE
THAT'S AWFUL FIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THANKS FOR US GOING TO
I SAID WHERE IS THE ENOUGH
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD LIFE
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPECT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMAN FEMINISM
THE OUR COERCIOUS HAS STRONGER PUTTING EARTH YOU ARE WHO A LOT OF BREAKING
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO TO BREAK THE THIRDLE
I LEARNED TO RIGHT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO RIGHT AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAIN FOR ME PERSON IN SEX PLAY FOR HIM
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL ATHOMICS
IT'S JUST TIME QUITE IT
WE DON'T LOVE READ WITH
I'M GOING TO BE SOHEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
A BIT MORE MONEY
THIS IS QUITE
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANET OUR WORLD BANK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT SO WRONG
THEY WANT A TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED IN HIS FACTORY
WHY NOT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE WITH
AND HE SURPRISED ME MY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FAST THAT I'M A SURVIVAL OF WHOLE FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THREE
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN AS A CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
STORIES THAT
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRUST SPECIES CLIMATE TRUST BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
SO LET ME REALLY TALK LIKE WE DON'T HAVE FROM THE EMAILS
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WEL
AND IN THAT I NEED A SEARCH RELESSON
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WHERE ON THAT CREATE
YOU KNOW WHAT INSPIRES YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
I KNEW MY THING
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
IT'S THE ONLY PART THAT'S BATTERY BACKED UP
THE GERMANY OF FRIENDS
FOUR TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO COUPLE DICTATORS
I WAS TERRIFIED
WHAT IS WE'RE DYING FOR
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE THE DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
THE NEXT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT FEEL THERE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS FILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
IT CHANGED THE WAY WE THOUGHT
THE POOR OF THAT
THAT'S YOUR IDEA
DID YOU FIRST THE TIME
WHAT HAVE THIS FIRST LONG
IT'S NOT TRUE
THAT WAS ONLY WHERE TO GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT EFFICIENT
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM WELL FOR THE LAST FEW SECONDS
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPEN WITH MY DAD
MY THE END IS ALSO I WAS DISEASED
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY SCARED THE MOVE
I'M TRYING TO BECOME BETTER PERSON
IF IT WAS SO HARD
I MEAN I NEED NOW HAVE TURNED TO ME LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
IF IT DECIDES RIGHT FOR HIS WORK
WE QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGED KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST CRUSHING POVERTY WIDENING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IN DEFINES DEPARTMENT THESE THINGS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALWAYS OR VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN THE ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WE'RE BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
SO WILL BE CONVISIBLE CRIME TASKS
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
THE FIRST MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW WHY SUCCEED
I HADN'T BADE IN THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND LIKE FRIES
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RACES A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS SATTERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICED MEDICINE CONSIDERS THE
I KNOW PLATFORMS I KNOW COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WAS THAT CHANGED ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE NUTRITION
I THINK IT ALL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
AND THIS IS HAPPENING DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDES
AND USED TO WHAT CREATES AN IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM A NATION
WHAT KINDS OF VISUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIARS
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WERE THERE
AHEAD I HAVE TO FELT COMPASSIONATE ABOUT THAT
AND SO OF KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERSITES THE COUNSELOR AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING THE DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS INTO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MY REAL LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE IS AN ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THERE WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOT LINE
THAT NAZIS INFLATED THE NETHERLANDS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE LOT OF REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY BB GUN
IT WAS LIKE US START RIGHT NUMBERS <unk>LG<unk>
I STARTED OPEN UGANDA
OR NOT SO FAST
I'M AS YOU SAW
WE HAVE TO FALL AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I STUDY AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWN
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL RIDING
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICAN HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILLST POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP AND HIS STOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULTS OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY I'D SPEND A PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 SPECIES OF NATCHED THE EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FRIEND FOR THE PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT'S THIS HAPPENED TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN
AND THAT'S MIND THE BUSY CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL OF
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES BUT
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEARTS
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE ENDS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN WELL BUT ITSELF HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT HUMILITY
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO LEAVE THE MORE
WHO'S US THE EFFECT
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIR TIME
IT WAS A POLLING
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR HUME
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVE FOR ME
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
REMEMBERS WHAT THAT SAID MY LIFE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IF THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPENT MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
YOU LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCORE
BUT IT'S USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO READ A FIGHT
YOU BORED THE PLANES
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOMES
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TO YET
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULD LIKE THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL LITTLE
THE SUPREME COURT HAS FALLEN WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE WHOLE SITES
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTNER
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL SEEM TO ME SO LET ME TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
THAT COOL IS THAT
NOW HAMLESSON WAS EVERYTHING MADISON WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GOOD OLD FASHION WAY
FIRST THEY FOUNDED POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW WE DID THIS DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE DO NUTSEE I'D EYE
HOW FAR WAVES FOR SHINE
SO THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
THAT IS REALS IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WAYS OF TIME
DO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO AND THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF FOR SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THROUGH OUR NO EXTERNAL CAMERAS
THE FACT IT'S MORE LIKE 5 PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BAND FROM THE GROUND TO THE CARO CELLS
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT ONE OF MY THINKIN
IT'S FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY'RE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DIVERSION VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOU AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANNEL
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRING FOOD STEMS EITHER
THERE IS AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORST
AND SHE'S LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE IN THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING WITH
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
I NEED THINGS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANKS THAT WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDER TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A D CENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF HOMONOPOLIES
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
THAT'S A LITTLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED AS I AM
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITOR THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB WE
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLUDE OUR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORSE
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH THE BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY IS SOMETHING
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OPERA ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU KNOW QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVED YOU
I'M IN THE CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FIGHT
SHE GOT A SUPPORT NEXT WORD
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHTS
IT WAS DOING ALL THAT
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHAT DO WE USE ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SETTLE OF CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORTH
IMAGINE JUGGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TROPICS
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT REALLY DO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ALL
IT'S THE COMING OF AGE FROM BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TREAT OR ATE FUNDING BEFORE CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
STAY DID DRIVE SPETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S THE BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN IDEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM IT WAS JUST A COMPANY THAT I WORKED FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WHAT SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WHICH BROUGHT US THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF DEATHS IN THE VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
DO THEY HAVE AGED
DO THEY HAVE A COMMON COLD
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
CO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT DAILY FIRES TO THINK AHEAD STRAGICALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT SO COMPETITION ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT
HOW DOES THAT WORK
THE SUM WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT HE MISSES
WE HAVE TO CANCER THAT
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SO WE'VE GOT OUT OF THE ARMIST IT ACTUALLY MADE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WITHIN AT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN HE HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO D
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO FOR
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE ON THE MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO FOR REALLY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT FUNNY INTO IT
THAT'S HOW STUFF IS MADE MEMORABLE
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USEFUL
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUMS
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
WE MORE WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
STICKNESS HEALTH CENTER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN WHO USED HER HEAD
ONE WOMEN FEEDS ON FRASH
ONE WOMEN'S ROOTS THEIR FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TWO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACE WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINES CURVED SPIVAL
LET'S FOR BOMBS LEFT BLACK
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
THEY WILL SIT IN THEM FOREVER
OF LITTLES SEVEN HAVING THE THREE WEAPONS
I AM PUSHING IN PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED THE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TALKS TO FARMERS
CASH WILL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXT THING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE IS USED BY REAL PEOPLE HAS THEM
TEXT THING HAS DEVELOPED WITH FROM THIS FLASH
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING THE OTHER THAN YOUR OWN SEAT
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO THINK CRITICA
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED IT
WE HAVE TO GET WIRED
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP TO SKIES AS LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEADS AGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB AND HIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS CAN BE
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVED DEPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOW ABUSE THE LIFE OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR CO WORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
AND I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO THEN I'VE BEEN EMBRACED A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WORKED OVER ME
BROUGHT AND YOUNGER MEN
THINK ABOUT MOVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS IS TRUE
ARE THEY ATTRACTIVE
ARE THE A POSITIONAL MEANS
WHEN YOU'RE SIX MAYBE TO DO THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOALS IN THOUSAND FACES
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE
WE HEAR THE CHAOS OF WALL
WE HEAR TERRORISM
THIS SIDE OF THE SOURCE IS NOT NEEDED TO BE SCIENCE
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OKAY THAT WE CAN MAKE A MULBILE DANGER COUNTER
WE CAN DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTSON MISS NO FISH
AS AN INVENSOR I TRY AND CERNED FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET LUNGS THAT'S HER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO FOR ALL PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S SO OFTEN WAIT
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IS A HOME OF SHELTER
FIVE YEARS AGO STAY
HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY HAVING EFFECTIVE EXAMPLE
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
COULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOL SEEMS TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD KEEP UP BEING
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF US FATTER
WHY IS THAT HARSE
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHICH WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVE INTERCATE STAY DREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY DEFINITIVE
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN USE YOU FROM THAT
A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE FRIENDLY THROUGH THAT
WHEREAS GIVING AND TAKING OUR MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES WHERE YOUR VALUES
WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS FOR OTHERS
THEY'LL SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO SEE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTION DESIGN
IT DOESN'T MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THIS WHOLE PROBLEM OF DESIGN BEING OFTEN MISSENTERS TOO FOR OURS
SCIENTISTS INSPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIRES
BUT WE WANT WHAT WE ASPIRE THROUGH IS CLOSED
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
BUT THAT IS THE FACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNS OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL TRUST CASE ON THE STREETS JUST GRAPHIC QUARTER FROM OUR OFFICE INSTRUCTIVE
NOW AT THAT TIME CAMBEL NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMED IN POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE LOW STICKY AND THEY WOULD WRITE SOMETHING ON AND THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON A BOARD
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OKLAND AIDS AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF FUTURE SEE
WE TOOK CAMBEDON OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS CRAZY BECAUSE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY AND COURTS
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARNOLD FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK TO
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
THE IMPACT SESSENCY
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
<unk>LG<unk> AND WHEN I TALKED TO EACH OTHERS AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BUY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T DEATH INFORMATION NOW
AND AT THE UP OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY'RE LIKE THE BASEBALL SCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTRUM THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THAT THEY WEREN'T LIMITED TO THE LOW
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WHEN YOU TRAIN THEM HOWEVER YOU ACCESS TO CAUSE AND STORIES AND WELL THEY ARE
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER CARLOS
HE WANTED TO SIT WHAT HE COULD STAND THE ROOM WHERE HE COULD THE PLAN ESCAPE ROUSE WHEN HE COULD GET HIS HANDS
HOW DOES CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE WAS OVER IT HELPED ME
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
I DON'T KNOW THEIR FRIEND
I'M THAT STORIES
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY END OF YOU
I WILL TRY TO DO WITH THAT
DID I GET MY UPGRADE
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF LIVING BACK
THAT SOUNDS SOME PROBABLY HAPPENED EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY REPREMANDING
EFFECTIVELY THE SALIBAN CREATES A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM FAST
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT LOVING THANKS OTHER ONES
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
IT JUST MOVED AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CAUTIOUS
JUST WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS TO THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
DID YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN TO WHAT YOUR HANDS KIDS DO
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
THREE MILLION PEOPLE PHRASE WITH CELL PHONES AND THAT'S THE TONIGHT
THEY DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE HOPE THE BIAS
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT AND THEY ARE ALL
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
HARDEST YOUR INTERNAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END OF THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S IN GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BUSINESS PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO STUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DATE FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TRUE OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES JOB
SO I STARTED TO RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN IT RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES A JELLYFISH AND MIDLIFE
OR A FIRE FLY
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
NO NOT HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYED
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERAGE
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN TAKE RIGHTS CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD EVER BEEN RECORDED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WEAR IS OUT
AND THAT PLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE A HEALER IN A STONING'S VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DIDN'T COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SLEEP IN ON THE SURFACE
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC
I AM SICK THROUGH MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TASK
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO READ HOW CREATIVELY INNOVATIVE THERE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS THAT GOES BANKRUPTS OR BY A FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORTH STAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
LIKE WE EVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMAN MENTAL WOMAN
I WANT TO GO
I WAS LIKE HOLE THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THAT FIGURES ARE SIMILAR OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT ONE UP PUNCHED MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BELIEVE WITH
BUT I WOULD GO IN ON OCCASION
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
IF THIS BECAME MY OWN WHOLE MINDFUL SAID SO
AND NOW OUR LOVE LANGUAGES
I KNEW NOTHING
AND THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANY MORE CARS
I HAD TO HAVE FAITH
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
IS IT ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO BE INVENTEDLY REORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WOULD IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IT'S SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OTHER
LET'S GO BACK TO VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT TO BE SURFISHED
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TIPS
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETITION
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET SOME MONEY ELSE
SHE WORKED IN A BANK
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
HERE'S ABOUT PALSE NEW
WHICH INSTANTLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT TO ME
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS GOOD YES
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT ALL WITH
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
YOU MIGHT GET A PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YES
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE FORGET TO GRAPH FOR THE PATIENT
SO WHAT MOTHER'S DRESS
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHY
NOW I KNOW WHY I AM HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
THE HUNDREDS IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG IN THE BIND
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT RIGHT
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
IS IT ABOUT EQUALITIES
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS WHO DRILLED HIS SELF AND SPREADWILLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING OIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW DEEP INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
I KNOW I SAID
I THINK I MEAN ONE OF THE PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR AND THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAS TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING AWAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARED TO THE HELPFUL
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO WAS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
NOW RIGHT NOW
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NO WAYS BACK
WE PUSH AND POOL AND POOL AND BROAD THINGS
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
THAT MOVEMENTS
WE WILL WANT
NOW THAT'S THE VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SMELL MONEY
WE WERE TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACT OF THE SESSION FOUND THE CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR SALE SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY IS YOU BRING THE STAB
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MINDS
I'M THE FISTERATION THAT <unk>LG<unk>
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON A AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I STUDIED SHAME
I THOUGHT I GUESS I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOUR WIFE LEFT YEAR
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT THE REASON NOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN AND STUDENT FORMS OF FEMALE NORMS
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS IN MEDIOCRE STUDENTS
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR IN AMAZON
THIS IS NON SENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
IT'S NOT TO ACROSS ME SOMETHING DISCRIMINATED
LOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE FINDING OFF
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW IT'S ONLY DIFFERENT THAT
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANING
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LIVE
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SORTS OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
WHAT DIFFERENCE IS MAKE IF THEY TALK LIKE CURY SIGN FELT
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFFERENCE IS MAKE
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
I WILL BE FACT
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THIS IS NOT TO PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS THAT 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO A POOR YOU WANT TO BE BRIDGE
HOW COULD I LET THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH A STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
THIS WAS ONE I WAS IN TEXAS
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OFF
IT WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEARTS
AFTER ALL I WASN'T BEEN AS CONVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS THAT INTEREST
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING 14 NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORSE
IS PRETTY COOL
WE HAVE THE PLANT
BUT IF THEY DON'T SAY EMBARRASS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMAN'S DAY WAS COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WELL WHAT CAN I KNEW ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK IN THAT
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MALES BE THROWN AWARE
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONTAGION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
COST SINCE BAKER MOTHER
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND WORK LIKE A DOLL
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S HOME
THEY WERE ALL WISE
THOUGH THEY FELT THEY FELT COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
I SAID WE WORK TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I'VE DEVOTED MY WORSE TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY HARN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE AND FLORID
YOU PROBABLY WORTH
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST INDEPENDENT MEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX VERY EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKS
BUT LEAST WE'RE STUCK IT
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER 10 YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRANK AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORK
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM I THINK THE EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WEIGH
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS AFTER LIVERING ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAID EVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST SAY HOME
THE CHOICE IS DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MOSS
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOTS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF ABOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB OF VISION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB BRIDGE AND THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S SOMETHING IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO EAT PETS
THEREFORE SO HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE THE MORNING
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULTY ADMIT TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING STORY THAT AS YOUR PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE ALBUM ORGANIZATION
YOU KNOW THEY DO POLES RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLLS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP GELS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROAD MAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT DONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT'S ABOUT MARS OF YOUR THING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T KN
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE DESCRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS GROWING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I WAS LIKE WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU THINK
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING ANY QUARTERS BECAUSE THE WASHER AND DRYER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM OF SAMPLE
YOU JUST HAVE ANY SPACE
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS
WE'RE LOOKING FO SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST LET BUSINESSES CAN BE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENCES TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKY ORCHET
HOW IS IT AMAZED
WHY WAS IT MADE
THEY FEEL AT HOME
