they want to be part of it
and they say i wouldn't work them about it but what would it mean about my career
i don't wor
sas action
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
well why is that
what difference is they ma if they talk like j yourise fat
we i want differences this make
ow i will maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is cooded
the boys you mind get me of home
it wasn't like them to misspractice
one percent who gets to do that
i didn't want to
i said in arabic
after college that does what needed to find the place to goall home
they could getit the jackpot
look at the endl and the animal
i'm in the cruiscipble right now
what is the abstractions
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on and opera all night long
that's what've moved to
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the wld
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of the anti reality tv
and it's hard and it takes couragece but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so naturally i asked what he is afric
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy a global mealword campaign
it should be inspiring
how do you know for sure
we created a diagnosed success
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply critical to our eomy
and i remember we had experienced with this
in other words a cornerould find these things because this is a fatal recipe
what can we do with all of us
roughly 30070 thse involved roughly 600 visions
what do we need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take stand for myself
patriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survival of all forms of sexual abrouce including three
and guess what silicon valley
i've tried engaging people
and they also knew that they could happen togh the workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people started contributing ideas
and that's actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
how to dinner with family
but these have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
when you train them however you adust causing accordings as re they are
he dn't wanted to say where he could stannd the room or ech just the plan  sate prouse we could get his hands
and that's exactly what that is
you remember calllos
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always tr to make it fstter
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to the sceptions
there's no more of it
so we did the analysis in the in a sightly different way
we pay 2 to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and vinit our equation
sustainability has got to be a precompetitivesu
and even if we get everybody working on we've got to beterpees
so was his mother trenth
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have an ow of you
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it's given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve justust
you don't have the same witnesses or depositions
again in a car
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
i was petrified
not a lot of cans
and when she went complained to a major he said what
sal hask me doesn'tiscriminate
they just do it
they all look the same mom it means to a first approximation
well i think about this all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
inders has putken rests
this is happening every day
they're looking and looking and finding love
how are you
i think this is a problem
petns drills in boxston
it makes more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like why did i really have to moot lon
it's not that they didn't want me critically
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
it that letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
well let's hold on of that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junkman' to be thrown away
you've broken your back
that iing really knowledge
these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding soil and guys
we need to be part of a community to survive
is it about equality
we all lo the inside with the answerers
we've not since we were babies
i started looking at them really carefully
it's about systems
i looked at my friend who drilled staf and dry well writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lost ourselves in the room for two days and we try to figure out what bound us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what it core values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brain to tune out with somebody else's issues
this meant that the movements demanding changed knew what they were a gasst crushing poverty whit
well very often we think about political change in defined apartments days
so i want to talk to you today but what i think is a much more complete recipe for deeper
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just part of the same species
we part of the same family
i have th resoughts so i see how they fight
and i won't name names because i who you are
we needed a disruption of real life and important work
we've all done it
brins ten degrees below zero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive choses of chemotherapy
and she suffered so much
thereus love and theirs friendship and there protection
do we merage
the question why did she staid
which is why that ivill led degree in the wall street job and h bright shin of future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguise his love one
he kept one and the gloved department of our car
and here's where those guns comen
i had just graduated from harvard college
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your cow workers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
and we were unprepared we overreaot
they're not my children
and i didn not know what to sayke
we can build healthier relationships a aboutnd race if we learn to calculate location
on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should you
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these iitle issues
you can try it
everything you use for some worere oute
and i ple my mind
how cool is that
that's nothing special
he had no choice
it had no choice
i realized of course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get tasked to mess it up
one of them got callled up in the water
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump and stomach thermal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just say home
so we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that god knows me
who worot fan
i tacked along with my neighbors
i'll meet you fair
and i said to myself and i want to get me one of that
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
boy it matters a loss
i said what do you mean
this is a great gu you
so i'm not saying that saying the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your job is seem challenging
the science is that
data drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated packatracking technology from the lujes company that i worked for
but we're not there again
you see there's a lot of things we just don't have data all
with that you can actually trigger eid funding before a crisis can happen
it's a wind all around
it's a communovatation for bringing data into the humanitarian world
and that's the big deal for a profession that's innight demad
and germany and friends
surely we know enough
four times the mass of the song
we have to get quiet
you have to or it
how come we do it
there's a flip side as well
is shocking to realize that only 28 of american
and will not forget the day we got that text message
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not to tellly one
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one an actual a text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
who is that the event
i am do it in my comporty
whatever it is about that prison where they were born things like that
here reconcciable differences great
they supported me all the way through it
that' something we had to celebrate
he's got better
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something was wrong
theid nazisch infvaded the netherlands
when i get out of this am i going to be reject thisce
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
we'd love to help him
blocks have names
we have no suspatters
we took camping off the top of the list as the most interested in america
i ran the camps the police department because of that
and all of thisse matters are crazy because we're probably safety toeth is the most important function of
but what you start to look at the data was by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus ono the data and analytics to help make their most critical decision
and at the op other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
it impacts sndency
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low levels drug cases on the streets just aroufter corner from our office interested
it abouts crime and violence
some people call it data science
and one of them said we had a grabbery two weeks ago
and they would take a dollow cick they would write somethingi and they would put it up on the board
they haven't yet been convicted of the crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i felt the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the orrnal foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have no suspects
now at that time came to new gergy was the most interestity in america
and when i talk to judges around in the united states which i do all the time now they all see the same
their let the pace pot down 20 years ago
he impacts everything
it worked for the oken hande and it worked in the state of lutersy
they're just waiting for their datly course
an i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
i'm 20 7 years old
and re connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a fosso profile for your facebook
what about you2
i was going through a hot time as well
i thouk what
it's the only part of spantery backed up
womens stairs coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results were off a surprise
i don't care
wealth it's ripped away from people who should be caught unproductive
they don't represent what hard views are it
we had the battle between jefferson and camelon
his economy won't work thomas jefferson is saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
you think the government should re distribute
and so we need to do better at copying their nationural environments to get them to crive
what makes the heart neat
i want to be the senser of attention
why isn itt not working
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
did you hea he as on your mind
thank you very much
why not just let businesses compete
and then i thought this got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
less it's hard
that's the status quo today
they ne is that what they need when they need it
of just six people
that you water stay there forever
quiet the oposite
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
so why don't we leverage that
who we leverage the cloud
we that's the bat
we need portable health benefits
how should we work
it's about earning as much as you possibly can
how should be there
we need to reinvently porganizing
i would never want to do that
take a look at for this
on we don't know that at home shelter
you don't have to pre iny waters because the washer drainer are free
so the leadership by humiliation
i said where is he now
thanks for asking
and they're not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we imagine
but it's not enough
i've built a coreer
thank you very much
you spend money
we will tolerate that
but when i was dill a lot remember he would kill flinds in our house with my be a gun
so to summerrise if we could offer a cop quality education to everyone around the world for free
that didn't go for really well
we can open up siting h all
i love building robotch
what about manipulation
so that's mobile pipulation
it didn't want it want you so badly
we can't identify with that party
that doesn't happen to me
make it go away
ma do it
mke itle re
thank you very much
it's all less teach you them how to ride a bike
but here's the thing
i don't know
and that's bad
it was a part
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
my parents came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of contention and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
so what it was that going to do
that is the right answer
constent baker motthley
how old are you
are the position made
are the attractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
i w when you're six people to do that
so i changed my immedia coed 1 th000 faces
what makes technology useful and usable
we happen to turn that rst
and that led me to this project
i became a psychology researcher and i have to vote my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
so what the church is often is a could
how do they operate
why are we embedditing social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from paring for her mother
how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
so we have these fnx and family cycles
so what do you think happens to this aal
we wce again when we get an n ancii gram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
and in fact it probably w
we've done the research
they're often not recognized at home
women are worth it
mre telling is not going down the'slowing up
she had to impersonate a man
so thank you for your attention
he told us about horome on replacement therapy
and not enough as being done about this
i'm not sure what it was
and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was abouty building the goods and products and now we have the surface
you would be tuing orders from the bove
but in fact it found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
this is a real mst cyam
he was also the first present to called me a feminist
my brother's lot' interested as i have
heouldome over and help me
how you change your behavior
even that wasn't enough
some did not everybody
she wanted to change policy at the government govern
we heat these cows
its not that tre
it's not option
they're not being shipped up peter
and what was the result of that
and that's why i's spent a pleasure speaking to yous
but it's not just china
we are the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own worlds
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just a rock in afghanistan
i do believe that we can fix what's broken
we all want to
he got part time ice
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history that's the one that we have
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of this geological record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the bass
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagined that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was only way to get anything done
efficiency is for robotics
human relationships are not efficient
that's available right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control of these forces
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had to stucky cover under her desk at school
but it's also an important day for another reason
but before that cooperation human realized ony was assassinated and that part of the
maybe i didn't experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket stuns
to pick up the keys
i should have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and pulling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military cademy
that's the work that stands before us
it's an unconsoud process
it's an authomatic process
we go out there and we copy our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
in fect it's more like five percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
and i'll have ansy
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other for a tip of water
they were unexpected pleasures
or where to love
how much can we change
so when we met chalck with the senior in high school
the question for us now is how much kid do we make our fes
not a single one
i will be back
it's the war and so on
but i love it forirst don'tally live all
they make sense of the past
but it wasn't just individuals
whater contradationion
but it's different
it's not put down of anyone
and ir responsible
it didn't want
i was brave enough for welcomeing
started to walk in the community and did take a rnding scientist to realize that they wren't
they need support
we had lagedul smis
so they won't go for a while they won't hang out with their friends they won't need
it cracks open my world
his name is lanie hah and he iss the veteran vietam
she would hide in the closet
they want to know how much exercise your dog is getaed
they want to know how often your dog gets outside
are you ding your mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem guy
so what happens next
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who is going to inherit his name and his withion
he also had 11 children
not thewisfe not the kids
it should not have been surprised
please look at me
so no more basicer
caption is actually not on the table
so it's up to usk
but i was going on ocasion
and this routine went on for some time
and now i love numbes
most of myriend would take a japanese
i was always very small
you nothing
so water was something that s going to be to begin with
so thought why not punish myself
and this became my wholely gree my rosta stone
and i tried everything
i thought this would be great fun
i'ming choose on
why was it maaze
it's a fucking or che
they feel at home
how is it madzed
making it about the other party
why don't weed to study this any more
what if the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse stasffes and planetary
don' we already know the consequences of a changing climate in our settle civilizations
imagine juggling a snowball across the topic
indeed we won the risk of making things worse
or're seeing the baby's brain
there were others like myself who were full time
and he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not a dirty word
but those surveillance features come at cost
government officials are extremely mad
i have to take a cear off
i exist because i have my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
they grow cropts
and so i think that nature does not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman
and this is crazy
i just disagree with this
i want to go
every kid lives he in nature
there's pollinnation going on
there's people everywhere
like we involved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
and i was like oh the amazon
and i'm sure the figures are similar oth hundred
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
the richinals were familiar
how could i come from the nationge
what kind of rituals are these
one billion people
but the magnitude is the problem is something we need to appreciate
i know it works
but i'm not happy
n wor to my dactghter
hes if a nice nice anybody
you might get a peiece pact
said let's start thin
i want to know how they impact me
i want to know how i impact them
lots of money
this is wait
it's a top creditor
i'm going to be so helpy
sporting local economies
i made more money
we've seen the image of our blue plant our world bank
ot loveed wradwark
we don't even need that much tim to do amazing things
yet what she has to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
what are you shir
so how do we do that
you say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in the day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working way more than full time cows
how are do we great new ideas
china is the worlds greatertanding poverty program over the last threew decades
i but some of our grandchiren probably will
thiss natural connected tissue
can we really scale this up
then they had to bring them in
but you know what the actal facts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't right
without it we literally can't interface with others
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find the way to globalize depoison or to
or any national leader
they would like the answer
they were arguing with one another about access to oly sits
the supreme couortantce fallen way down from what it used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have us
there would be invisible capacity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first t10 people to have this surgery
because we have stemso
when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my childs developolitism
that was powerful
rais sh your hand
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the heating earthquake
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carred on back from the ground to the carot cal
and we couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing is throwest
going there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformation the climate transmitation we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw' writt down toos
that's sort of the state of the eye
and now we want to do a double double of the age way of coming through
and so they took them to some safe place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what it happens to my brain
we now have a platform
and my own world didn't become
and uses that benterfit
i'm a professor and were passionate about education
well we bought one of these
ga on mad
but there's actually more to a story than that
the oil will never bring out
what's different is how molecules are put together
effectively the tardi bol traate a complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so poor they have no resources to get their fat
if any child is found violating these tools he is severely reprimandly
does the an e this fatter
i'm not military right
one was a p assault with
they signed it because they wanted some form ofvenge
the other was to be a baseball player
but if they don't stay in pairiss the international pressure will be overwhelming
pretyoo
we have the plan
i am thinking of your love for me
paying ce through my body with the fires of my lung view
i am torn by you love for me
remember what i set my lifve
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
we might say then well let's not worry about this
that means at some point it's going to be new problem to you
how does it happen
he was like a star trap
and that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
we can create a dec centralized database that has the same efficiency of monopolies
we can see everything in wikipedia
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is that possible
they're mmorrons so that we don't how my immines
they have bad ideas
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people care about this study and they're like great if i want to get better my job is just need an upgrade my present
they know you can fail by starting a business goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winow has come from a different cribal group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need a search to be electure
and this wasn't just an abstryg question
i couldn't care myself away from the coverage
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
and others resented this comparison between gay rights civil rights and
we're looking for something more
i do like magic
you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that may always be the case
we can't change our minds
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboh characters
i got about 3000 emils
mic website
soin then i've been depression a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much potential
it's about proving who you are and what you can do
brought in the other man
i went back home and i said daddia i don't know who i am
and it a trob
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
you board the plane
the engine fails
the plane takes off
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
there were no bad doors
how do you get to build those relationships
you've just had to new things sometimes
so we created a new stool
and poor they were like what
but that doesn't mean that we can't
now that's a very very good play
what were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this is why i heood from a lot of how rich people
the answer was no
this is how stuff is made memorable
and i got putty into it
do you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
now i know why i'm here
well guess whaty
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of tramam i talking about here
for hpatitis it was also two and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bit
and that' pere meazy
but eventually they didn't come around
you are healer in a stonge village
and so it's perfect for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
they're not stillonated
and use is what creates impact
because we can't
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
there's no other weight
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis iss getting worse day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new productor service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
n we can make a mobile catergether
we can't get volunteers
we can drive around
thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of them
imagine if we had across the country right now in local places been
i have passionate in my hearts
it's just a walk
both of them bring the imaginations to life and way is that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
well not yet
has the whole hearing movement
look at this pretty structure
their faces broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will paint dividendce
and in many cases we don't
but we all shouldd
d replies so often you won't even notice it
that wasn't case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no more charged before you
and then something falls off the walk
i can hurk the way
only one percent of the people are actually farmers
jk to famerss
so what can we do
who cares about poni
they don't get their money out
neeve my child
she works in the bank
i believe it's a story there has to be toold
i have to report it
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
and is on the spot absolutely yes
he was smiling and we said go
we've been working together what since we were kids really
was brought us to it
you done too much shacking
it wasn't who i was
here's where i stand
they don't have meaning
to change the way we taught
had new ideas
the move it
why don't they trust al long
they don't trust the alarm
it's not true
we don't consult we don't use fetial
so what to do with acc
but i need your helpet
what is that
she contacted anyone and everyone who was fitting to buy my w
give me input
there's nothing underground about it
it's right there for you to find
we only sell you airtimpe
which means take my camera
iat there on the river for two months without seeing one
i need things i am saying to take my picture
think well
why are we ipping over this
this is a really important chapion to me
i once stands relationships
i went to the dan
do an incredibly important work
and so many of my early memories involved in chokids day dreams where i was walking across borders
one year i came up with a bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the words
you made it work for me
we know why kids don't learn
it's known spry the monket
i looked at slames
it's not a lot of money at the global level
how could i l them down
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
so is what it was and what it can be
let us have a hong kong nearby
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
i wasn't very good at reading this
we're on the drink
thanks very much
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scared to the hopefy
there won't be a single moment in the schedule
i don't paint it
it's going to become really freaking obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad scis
again it will not happen overnight
i mean everyone did
it needs to happen
is it heavy
let other people worry about it
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
where would it go
you can experience their sense of place
who would i mean
should i go there
the whole interenst
i was looking for this thing that only fool seemed to look for
you can walk around them
you're all collective
so what is an iutory
and it's completely ok what's the dres
here i'm one person talking to you
we just need to keep going
we don't need more long continue
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial stage
ian we have problems that we desperately need to solve
three million people toay with sell phon andtsternet
don't create solutions to impress contribution
so what did they do
why is it important now
and not just that
they worent together
and he was talking about the importance of coaching poisses and men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
and let me just put this in context
and know what else we did
and that's what we think
we met men wh they were at and we built a program
why do i believe this
we were obviously making a difference
take us look at one of our spots
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still missing a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertisement council and we asked them to help us
this is your chance
which inali is only a third correct
i don't mean giving up the internet
it is my belief that to create these rare camp chances requires to pull off at these
what you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
why d do you get several things
so they added oxygen to methane gas
the gas that they use at first and medications with oxygen
and to do so we've had to believe and impossible things
that's what we do
you were born too
of those seven def loocar weapon
but it's a global phenomenon
just need about it
it's very hard to get off course
we're going to stay with them forever
but that ister face is beautiful
and does itt matter
i was talking about interaction design
designers aspired to be really great designers
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
it's like once again there is the whole problem of a 9 being often pretentnder sood for art
what we want what we aspire to is the coldest
i don't understand
someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserve so much more
go i said again sweat forming on my brown
for african homgrn science fiction can be a will to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political right here
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
it is in the water
i was faulting most of the time i had to restarted over and over before it worked
it's a marker of empathy
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language is used by real people asas them
texting has developed one from this slash
that's what texting is
and so how did your brain give you that detail
i know i have
predictions on the basis of every experience that you have
is's us the past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
i'm tot and serious
not what he did
they are the basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like commness and
well that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we're going to go even deeperth than the human body
when in the history of humanity has ever been possible for one person to rahm what
they also monitored the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we're going down to the cellular level of these days
i struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
what if i had told you my story years ago
after all it wasn't bit unconventional
they have different interests
but it's not about fire in bringstone either
it means for youth and it's a new arab tv cha
there is an animated series in the works
and she was looking as young as ever
they have divergion values
theregh our no soal camerers
the economy needs them
i wanted to understand who takes the job
who cleans up ab for cut
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project with them
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
and this leads to audence
but this is the source of innovation
if we're still hungry we might have some more
we're not playing with each other
there's someetingle difficul ways to eat peaza
but if you want't move we'll have the no choice but you'll run you gow
i went to extreme length that tided to be straight
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
i see now i never was one and not the other

my father worked atis factory internet

we just need to act on it
well i didn't have any idea
it would be a mall and not a par
i had to have f things
our city couldnt possibly handle any more cars
how is that possible
they want their treatment
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might so wrong
we are all responsible
but that's kind of a big problem
so after 25 years o the end to fel as though i was running dry
they were sitting in forever
how do i get through the hardest part
so momentum is good
and then what happens
often what happens is your planning so hard for how do i get through the hardest part
not how much
or a fight fly
please sign here right now

it is powerful
why doest get in feasib in life
it's more anoying
last week ago i got 238 pieces of nasty email and more
but i'm a big fan of you as a person

make me laugh
what are the researchers learning
i no i dida
so i was jealous
i think i'm the normal person
and i was really scared
but i found one
the iry so obvious right
that's next to impossible
so i went in that direction
but that is what it needs to have a domain of expertise
was we dying for
i didn't know where i was
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to

and i want to make the point that is members of society we need to

i was considered a radical

i didn't knoway succeed
why are you really here
and i cried
i hadn't baded in three days
i was winning awards

wh i was surprised

i hope that we can all be a little bit brave for we most thingsuch brave forrie
some boys brokeb me when i was so young i did not know what boysons do to break at gir
i am full of contradictions

i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty thingies
they are gorgeous and hestron brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
we have the right to respect
i want you know part of any of that
i learned to wite like them and then i learned to wait as myself
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticisms to dissecting any g ofen woman's feminism
it really is quite phenomenal
who will walk inspire you and why

5 the day
how is that possible
that is great
thank you very much
how much d they do

your wife lut chia
i said a shame

he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
we should have been nationuralistic
wh there is a delf fulfilling prophecy

we really look at how is of the young people spend most of their time using new technologies
what is it that message
some of them got out of the army and had tremendousychological problems when they got home
how doid that work
that's what so complicated about war
it's not what i had expected
it was incredibly high
the boys are up there frontier
we have to answer that
they're too busy putting out daily fires to think it has sueially
and they don't need to ask for permissions
that's my question
what is like talking about
let me illustrate this
this is completelydough
that's a terrible week of time
so that only if you're paid by the yowrs
now it was something different now
that would not work
you're more consciously
it is the default option
and you walk around and it points the things
you just move away
now hemilton was everything madicine was cght
first they've down this political parties
and they did it in the goodld fashion way

with doing ok
that was her fight
she learned about h rice
75 of them are women and children
she got as support networks
now wewn specialities combining digital technology and passion
it's almost becoming theisinax of the dual language
it turns out the evidence takes oth the ones
it's a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people spend more honor drinking or smoking or that people
young people as well
let's help them have a voice
and that's what we sid
we can tll you with them
the time of theutoriseses not need to be silist
we can chaos ofvar
thank you very much

they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments and nonprofits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this with
this is possible
given one it so hard
that's what happened with my dad
they get scared to move
they get scared to walk around
my dad is alzheimer's disease
i'm trying to you a better person
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
they want a game
and the problem worth solving is what are those things
don' bear with me
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i know platform dan computers they put me on the internet when i was young
as they did all world frame
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
why didn't you just tell me that
what can i learn with you
let's find a goal
so that wasis ease it
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
we weren't considered the real thing
so we need the solutions and theedse people pay the game they are trying out
so that's it for now
that's awful right
and one act ofv this actually found a contract from a western company for sale surveillance
and it's just incredible
i was sertrified
the same tool that united us to drople dictators
let's not to say it's impossible
growing up i was sos intrigued by how people think
againet's displain
i don't look there for up

now i'm try to g for my interview
i needed an education
did i get my upgrain
we must adoppt that way of giving back
i'm not short
i will find there with thing
it is my fears old
and i thought what am i thinking
it's not one way
and that's what i'm calling for years now
so you want to go to that board meet but you only want to pay attention to bited interest
so what do we do
we almost don't feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
do the same thing it work
and so one of the major challenges of our processs really is to find photographs that we're taken before something
we said yes
we were so excited
ingredable people are warm and friendly're night the polite
the s ie surrounded by much for stakes and sharks

whas even in taking a more of your innermotives with your values
and he said well i just cared so deeply about my customers he i would never sell them more of crappy products
and we think about it it makes a lot of sense because formul a question is a really complex
let's think about your ethical footprint
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
he said a technology connterence in plorida
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably wote
we have to fix the internet
most in the ped of meaniing was shut down
now don't get me wrong
of course they would
i could make that decision
that's not an improable tip
you know about number
you did navigate space
you saw him back n
maybe me feel smart
how c can somebody like that make you feel smart
i don't even know this a real job sitle to be honest
it was the coldest i've ever been
