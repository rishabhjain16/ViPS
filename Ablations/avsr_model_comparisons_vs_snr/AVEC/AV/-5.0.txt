i would maintain
i think what that meants that people couldn't see what was in front of them
like this good
the point you might me of home
it wasn't like them to mis practice
i pretentnd you get to do that
i don't want to
it's not the arab
after all that's what need is findabl hle
they need the jockp

i'm in the crudciible right now
what is the abstraction
you no question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an opera all d that long
that's whatve moved you
i know you understand that
i have' ida fst in the world
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind ofide reality
and it's hard and it's courage but that's why we're alive 
nobody comes and famous
how would do that
so actually i had really defit
and it doesn't
and to sx days to deploy a global malntword campaign
it should be inspiroring
how you for surek
we created a diag that success
im thin youo mu somach
that is not simply critical to oney
and i remember exed this
in other words a corner find these a fatal recipe
what can we do it
roughly 370 th of rougheren sis visions
what do we need to do

i've tried engaging people
and they all kne that they can t happen to the workforce
i don't know
people'k
people tart losem ideas
and that's actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super reeal and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
how was liter with family
but these have changed
but just imagine for a moment what needs me to feel like
when you train them however you aj just c your c
men want the same way down the room or int the plan same prics weid ts hand
and that's exactly what that is
you remember call los
needs be able to do something with it
we're always done to many function
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how can you inform
so it's in the demand that bring them to deception
there's no more of it
so we need the analyis and in it slight a different way
we makee two or three times more than anybody else
let's go back and this therey question
sustainability has got to be a pret peditu
even if we did everybody wor we've got some masalpationion
so w motherd twat
well that's going to be bringingwrou pro compasion
i don't have the uni for
let me give you a simple commercial example
more just is not thetention any m in life
just as response
because it is giffered by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve just

thousand of women started reach out me to share their own stories of pain ading shame
i was spectrified
not a lot of cats
i want you w to the princh formaor said what
ras me d dcriminate
they do what
they all the same it means to a firstppspect
well i think about this all the time
but now cheat not where they go on our treat of life
it's just not possible
i de thats rest
it noting every day
they're looking and looking and finding love
i w you
and this is a problem
but the drw' watching
it makes more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like why did i really have tomotke her
it's not that didn't woman think crickly
you can't run around in the dark
what did i do about it
lady stuff happened without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
well let's hold on to that converge to me
it's like a bit of junkman to be thrown away
you've broken you back
that really acknowledge
these guys canould be good to purpose was  thor the gus
we need to be part of the community to survive
it's about quality
we all oearn the beside with the answer is
we noted we were babies
i started looking at them pretty carefully
it's about sixems
i looked at my friend tri def ry well riting off more than a billion does for the
it's very hard to make them putint a very ragal decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lock ourselves in the room for dow dad and we try to figure out we' bound us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what cre values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brain to do down with somebody else'sissue
this mat that the movements deband changed knew what they werea crashing poverty one
were very often we think about political change and to find apartment date
so i want to talk to you today but what i think is a much more blety recipe for deeper
a couple of years ago a group ofisate decided that we were eating the limits of what we had accomplished
so that's what i'm doing it
we're not part of the same sp this
we part of the same family

i didn't know what to say
we can build healthy of relationships around rates if we don't covelate ok
on the other hand statistics that's the subject that you could it should you

you don't get chanked to mess it up
one of them grew up a rooting

there's going to be new system based on donated back tracking technology from thgic company that i worked for

texing has a 100 open rate
he told me not tellly one
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one the actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we need to build the crazy text online
could is that the event
i am doing mylf
whatever reiiced about that puton where they weport things like that
irconsigable differencees raat
they supported me all the way through it
if that's something we had to celebrate
it a gut better
we'replaced with people who listen to us

we shok came to cof the top of the lens as the most interested in america
i ran the came to police department because of that
and all of these matterners are crazy because we're probably saveomething is the most important function of the
but what you start to look at the data was by the way if your judges don't have when we stook to look at the data
so i decided to focus on to design and anthale to help make their most craitical decision
and at thep other as the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
in thepact teidency
and 67c of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level trin dats on the streets just af the ororner from our office tereusting
in about crime and violence
some people call it daite
and one of them is said we had grabery two weeksgo
and they would take a dollow city they would write themi and they would put it up on the boarder
they haven't y been confidcent of your crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive adminature they were time consuming and they were limiting to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united statesday i felt the exact same way that i did about the stateive
so when i started my jobing to go on the foundation i came bagine looking a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have no suspect
now at l that time came to new jersey was the most interesting in america

it worked for the old cand and it worked in the date of luter team
they're just waiting for their dad course

this is not a fhoto profile for your facebook
what about truh
i was going three hot time bee
how watch
the coly piny iss better back up
woman here deing up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do do re such of theenturpls
i don't know
wealth it's ripped away from people who just be caught up productive
they don't represent the what ourterfusw arey
we got to the battle between jeffesis and camagin
an won't worry im cheff say that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is
but that'so much k of problems
so i'm in the media
you think the government should reads strip
and so we need to do better and cop in their actual environment and them to rive
what makes the hard read
i want to be the study of attention
why is it not working
this is what i' supped toually be able to do
d you ygain y c mind
thank you very much
why not just let business just complete
thatn i thought this got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we would't not be there
let it's hard
that's not too today
and they need when they need it
go fe just six people
you w forever
quite the open
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype was thatet used to make free open source offtware so that others do not have
so why do we leve to sha
who we never trate clouds
i' like to imagin
we need portable oth the benefit
how should we run
it's about hurting as much as you possibly can
how should be there
we need to reinvently b organizing
i would never want to do that
take a look for this
no we don't know about their own cheler
you don't have to prety wats because the washingt gring on free
so heere bet your reaction
iid where is it now

pick up the keys
i didn' have know ie what
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and pull it for this object
my research team and i went to one point military namemy
that's the work that stands before us
hes that un good process
it's that authomatic process
we go up there and we copy cars and we run from pla to place
i really do this
in fect it's more like ive percent
and we find the fear that i do it
i don't have an easy
sometimes thirose furather

indeed we want the risk of making thins worse
you see the bab' brain
there were others like myself who were full time
it's a bad night
the childre we d' love this spot
it's not an a dterney word
but those surveillance features areing cost
if we to fish are extremely bad
i have to take a cear off
i didn't have my women friends
and guess what
i d know
they grow crops
and so i think that nature is not that was not touched by human micro woman
and this is great
i justid agree with this
and we know
every lives internatal
there's poies going on
there's people everywhere
we involved on this planet in the contact of all the other animals with whatich we share
i was like oh was
and i'm sure the fingers are similar oth the hundreds
we've just some now forgotten how to d it
the riginald would remainish
how could i come from the nation
what kind of resuce are these
what manion people
but the mat the problem is something we need to appreciate
i know what it works
but i'm not happy
ould my daughter
even  ight whekpa
you might get a peace plck
it's a loo stu thing
i want to know how they impacts me
i want to know how i impact them
a lot of money
's wiat
it's a top creditor
i'm not being so helpy
upporting local economies
i make more money
we've seen the image of our blue plan our world bank
got love waywk
we don't even mach do amazing things
now we she had to find seven hours because you ded to water allver her basement she found
what are youw chird
how do we do that
you say you're worriing more than just hours
that's like finding an  rwer the day
but you can write it
and that's even if you working a way more than full time hours
how are do we great to ie
chining the worill treat ex siting poverty program over the last of forw decades
i but some of our grandchildren problebly weill
its natural connected tissue
can we really scale to something
then they had to point to me in
but you know what the ants with facts are
but now it's turned around
i take get to traby
my history wasn't right
without com meing really are datterfaced with others
my dister had disappin was still very powerful
and it iss important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the values in with those public spaces where we come together
the world and unless we find the way to globalize the pulb or

we're g that
they wererg we would want annder mter ac
simplyws fall way down from what you should be
we need to create a global parliament of pars
they do dat
a huge opportunity and aition of new potential for innovation for development
but the questions who will havegh
they will be invisible  notity
of course myigrdation will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first that people have the surgy
becauseus we have to damp cho
when i was say i didn't realize i was baing it wasse
i was able to do more th
why my child developrism
that was pow of you
what youeat
it's actually not that hard
we lost the valuable danors
that was a huge problem at the end earth theway
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to live me carry on mad from your grandout caryal
i me you couldn't just send it off
it came from the way which bejic controow didn't
go it
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformations climate transmition we have to design to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw of f this dounable
that's sort of the state of the eye
now we want to do a double double of the ageway of coming through
and so they turned them to some safe place
you sha how does happ
in fact what's the time your my brain
we now have the planfirm
and my on words d' become
i used that p
i'm a professor i re passionate about education
well we bought one of these
gab man
but there's actually more distortant than that
the old will never ber out
what's different is how molecules are put together
effectively the dardi bology had a complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so poor they haveo resources to get them fa
if any child is found finating these tools is deveilling reprimonding
the e f
i might be right
what would the beig told
let's sign it because they want to form for a fenish
the other one to be a bigball player
but if they don't stay it bears the international pressure will be overwhelming
it's preicl
we have the plan
i was thinking of you rou for me
being through my body with the fis of my lun fe
i am talking about your lo for me
remember when i doneid my love
and i kind of know
i remember when you said to me
we might say that well i worry about this
that means at some point it's going to be new problem to you
how is that
it was a s anyportunity
that leads to a very powerfer to
and that might be the case
thank you very much
we creat anndndentralized statamente that has the same efficiency of monopolly
we see everything wikipedia
it's the positive view that's constantly changing to be updated
and how is that possible
n i'm wrong sou that we don't have howbanymains
they have mad ideas
the che the possit to run out how creative inovative there
i'm the opposite
so people hear about the study and they're like great if i get better my job i just end upreat in my prson
they know you can fail by strcumos barupt or by failing started musiness datle
because he's here the winnter has come from a different crimal group
they have to be able a to teacher something as well
and in that is to e lecture
and this wasn't just in i' was trying to question
i couldn't care myself away from the cfnce
african americans supported it at a higher level that had ever been recorded
and others retecting the comparent between right different rights and
we're looking for something more
i do like imagice
you just have to find another term and look at that up
someet it's not that clean
that my goalways be the case
we can change our own minds
they're completely flct and they' mission and carbod characters
i got about 3000 miles
myic new website
so then i haveve been a picture a lot of people have've worked over to me
but there's so much protectal
this is about proving who you are and rich is
bght
i went my home and i said dad did i do know what i am
and this is true
no one to land had any idea anything gone wrong
you bore the plane
the engine fails
the plane ticks of
they dreamed up a variety of horrified scenarios
there were no bad chals
how do you get to build those relationships
youve just had to do things sometimes
so we created a new sour
and boor they were like what
but that doesn't mean that we can
now that's a very good point
what w wrong
we have to decidn what it means
but this is the way i could c fromome a lot of how rich people
the answer was th
this how stuff that is made memorable
i got putty into it
you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous fish s option
now i don't want to come here
well guess what
for depression it was flid lifetimes
what kind of crama my talk about here
for happatitis it was also two and a half gams
children areepecially d sensitive to this repeat transactivation
well imain you walking in the foor and you seep
and not to put amazing
but eventually they didn't come around
you are here so luge fish
and so it was perfect for something like thatght
we can sep beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidied
they're not still gated
and uses will creat impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just stuffere expression
n of weight
i didn' know youct have to have creative tro
so withich women's experience as it resents mentoring
so this is obvious right
we now have a more challenge than is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis is getting wor day by day
soill the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters of new productal services
we don't have money
we all know this
okll make a mobile cater
we dn't have v ideas
we drive around
thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of them
imagine if we had across it on right now in local pla been
i have passionate my e
it's justesn't walk
both of the brain imaginations to life and what is it reminds that all of our bos the end
i can stand up and do something
well not that
as the whoolder than movement
look at this pretty structure
their face is broadcast their experience
buiing can be like of people
why is that hard
that would tke everything with was today
this will payint distance
and in many kids we don't
but we are sure
day replyi so often you won't even notice it
that wasn't the case of me
we all know what' talking about
no war charged before you
and then something falls off to work
i can call it the one
oly one percent of the ppri de fo
so your frinds
so what can we do
who heares about boxi
they don't get their money house
take my child
she worked in theer back

and so many of my earning memories involved tate dreams throughout walk aross borers
one year i came up with a bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and after stombod works
you mad work for me
we know i don't look
spa the money
i looked at slames
it's not a thou of but glbal ever
can lect them down
sometimes messy it's always impredicible
so was what it was and what it got me
i doesn't have all on your biny
they want to go out
allow many people comome in
we share ideas we all get poor
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of the door before right
it wasn't very gool we have this
whatre on the greid
thanks very much
so they don't have to rely on people get in stans and hopefuy
there won't be a single moment indanual
i don't man it
it's going to become really freaky obvious
so how this you work
we changed the economics for the bad gus
again it will not happen overnight
i mean everyone did
it needs to happen
is it heavy
it ma like other people worry about it
was the internaction a place that you could visit it
where w we go
you can experience their sense of place
what i mean
ould i go that
the whole is direction
i was looking for this thingk that only fool seemed to look for
you didnt walk around them
you're all collective
so what is not negr
completely ok what you don't
here i'm one person talking to you
we just keeproen
we don't need more tong than you
i think we need something like about aat project on the topic of arvishi dation
we have problems we desperately solve
we mean
no to to impress
so what did they do
why is it important now
and not just that
they went together
and he was talking about the importance of cting points of man changed the coat of the lock room and given
and let me just put this in context
and no one else we
and that's what we think
we met met when they were at and we built a program
why do i believe this
we were obviously magatic difference
take us look at one of our spons
and i have to tell i passionate about that
we were maaking what was it invisible visible
but we were still menty critical ailment
and so knowing that we went to the advertisement council and we asked them to help us
it chan
which it's only thirdrac
i don'tant to giveve them the internet
it is my belief to create thisse rare captains require surble off this
what you know where you all and exactly what's timming is
we you get several things
so they had an oxygen to methode gas
the gas that they use their first commedications with oxygen
and to do though we've had to believe and impossible things
that's what we do
who will barrn you
if you seven sefl the weapon
but it isn't a global phenomenon
just think about it
it's very hard to get of course
we're going to stay with them forever
but that ister face is beautiful
it doesn't matter
i was talking about interaction to say
designer the spiers w be really great designers
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reaction that we've had troth
not attc quce again this whole problem off a time being often preenters for us
what we want what we get to bire trees coded
i don't think
you someone who has that kind of our disimpreotenti theres so much more
no i dn swit for me and my browd
for africa h br science fiction can bew to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political right
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
is in the water
i was faulting most of the time i had to re started over and over before it worked
is the marker of empetition
catual speech is something quite different
any spoken languageespy real people ask them
texting has developed one from this slash
that's what texting is
so how do your brain give you that is it
i have
predictions on the basis of every experience that you have
iso compats experience based simple situation try to make meaning
i'm totally serious
what he did
they are the basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like commonce and
well that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we' are going to go even deeperth than the human body
when in the history of humanity has never been possible for one person to rahm
they also monitor the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we're going down to the cellular level of these days
i' struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
what if i had told my 20 years ago
after all it wasn't been as intivental
they have different interests
but it's not about firing brsto her
mean for you and it's a new arabsivic chain
and fere the work
're looking at9 at evone
they have diriversion values
through the dambers
the aconomy e is
i want to understand who get job
who eed e for cut
take a moment say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started with new project with them
i wanted to get to know them as individual
and this leads to hudce
but this is the source of innovation
live work still hungry what might have to more
we're not playing with each other
they're sh of whatays keat peaks
but if you wonant't move if we'll have to knowo choice buton' re ne you cow
i'm going to extreme pength that's going to be stight
and the soldier on the front dan said we have unconditional orders to destroy this

one woman scrapped herself
where do refugeerts go
l do bombs left belind
one woman never did

one wom be truer faces
ofvers contaminated to batter
withythm is to have silence
one woman gives both as their baby
wh i asked all of the ss do that understand
my father worked in this factory internet
my grandfather worked at this factory
i imagine what might happen because every reason has something to offere
even pcil farmers in leverage
it's not  same as on about torit or anything else
it's about people

china constraint terms of familersge more land actually available far culture and it has massive
we just need to act on it
well i didn't have any idea
it would be a mall a bar
i had to cfit
star city couldn't possibly eate any more cars
how did that boin them
they want that treatent
you have to have height that experience of breaking to the otherwise something went o wrong
we are all responsible
but that's kind of a big problem
so after 25 mill a wee so i' be fing dry

maybe that
were the researchers learning
no idea
so i was jealous
they ie a g a person
i really sv
but i found one
hry so obvious right
that's next to impossible
so i went in that direction
mean that is what it he the abolito mat of experts
which wasre dying for
i didn't know what i want
raat social category that has staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
and this idea is that d nothing news
one way around this is to draw pictures

but youre stucky
we have the tools but we like the collective wooland moment
but fortiner many women that's not the case
she found us we found her disease
the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds hadom be thrownout

and it's an issue of quality and the tality of science and medicine
and then we would long discovered something

and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
everybody focuses on the things to kalied and that's what i was focused on

we can't see it most of the time
dorou w your hand in my room
so why is it

and then you part right

my life with the dogs

this is what is trut
when you go poor do you want to be riched
getting our college education is a 20 year investment
now oteruriousse moving are actually really important
stories that is so important

they have been tldught by their families often to wealthy arabaturists
about a year after 9 11 research damaged their foodp women who were pregnant when were exposed to the world
by the great passion is the environment
so let's get started now
i was considered a wat

i didn't know what's toc
why are you re here
and i fine
i had ba with age

we have to bke so respect
i want to know p of an f
i learned a way like them and then i learned away as myself
we go far beyond reasonable construct difereism to dayay today if it would be feminism
it really is quiteh homenal

we really look at how rech of the young people spend most of their time ne goo technologies
what isess
some of fot out of thecmon tremendsychological problems with' got homes
how does that work
that's whats soo comblicated about war
it's not what i had intpected
incredibly high
the boys drupt out fr you
we have to hed that
they're too busy to brt outnating fa they cana
and they don't need to ask for pmission
that's my question
what is like talking about
let me illustrate this
know
that's a terrible week of time
so that only if you're paid by hours
that it' beoo for now
that what that works
you're more conscious
this is a default objin
you walk around and waste the things
just move away
now amleton was everything that mgicine was not
first they've down this political parties
and they did it in the goold fast a way
they change from person supporting
so it's more about tapturing an idea than about capturing eopentry
were doing ok
that was her fight
she learned about it rich
75 of them are women and children
she got at su port network
can we always been shelling passion
it's almost becomingistax of visual language
turs now ev one

so you want to go to that pointment but you only want to pay attention tore b interest
so what do we do
we almost don't feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
somphing work
