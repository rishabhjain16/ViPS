they want to be part of it
and they'd say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career
i don't know
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
well why is that
what differences it make if talk like jur sign fell
well what difference des this make
ow i will maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is good
the boys reminded me of home
it wasn't like them to mispractice
one percent c get to do that
i didn't want to
i said in the arabic
after college i desperately needed to find a place to call ho
they can hit the jack but
look at the end to see the animal
i'm in the crucipal right now
what is the abstraction
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on and opera all night long
that's what moves you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the world
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of the anti reality tvs
and it s hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so naturally i asked what he is african
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
it should be inspiring
how do you know for sure
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply critical to our eonomy
and i remember we had experienced with this
in other words a corner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe
what can we do in all of us
roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 senior visions
what do we need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stand from myself
patriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
and guess what silicon valley
i've tried engaging people
and they also knew that they could happen to a workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people started contributing ideas
and that's actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
out toginner with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
when you train them however to adjust caution according to where they areught
he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could the plan escape browse we could get his hands
and that's exactly what that is
you remember carlos
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always try to make it faster
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to the taptures
there's no more of it
so we did the analysis ing in a slightly different way
we paid 2 to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and vit our equations
sustainability has got to be a precompetitive issue
even if we get everybody working on it we've got to be strategic
so was mother tersa
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have an overfall
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it' is given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
again in a car
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
i was petrified
not a lot of hands
and when she went to complain to a major he said what
sexual harassments doesn't discriminate
they just do it
they all look the same butre mys i mean to a first approximation
well i think about this all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
and dance has progressed
this is happening every day
they are looking and looking and finding love
ow wh are you
i think this is a problem
beth's els in boston
maks more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like why did i really have to mootor lon
it's not that they didn't want me think critically
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
soll let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
you've broken your back
the key here really knowledge
these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gass
we need to be part of a community to survive
is it about equality
we all know deep inside what the answer is
we've none since we were babies
i started looking at them really carefully
is it about systems
i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lost ourselves in a room for two days and we try to figure out what bound us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its core values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issues
this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty whitking
well very often we think about political change in defined compartments in these days
so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deeper
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just part of the same species
wepart of the same family
i have three sights so i see how they fight
and i won't name names but you know who you are
we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
we've all done this
in it's 10 degrees below zero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive joses of chemotherapy
and she suffered so much
there's love and there's friendship and theres protection
could we merge
the question why did she stay
which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one
he kept one and the gloved compartment of our car
and here's where those guns come in
i had just graduated from harvard college
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your cow workers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
and when we're unprepared we overreact
they're not my children
and i did not know what to sae
we can build healthier relationships around racees if we learn to calculate locakees
on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should youe
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11 o'clock they stoped talking about these detly issues
you can try it
everything in universwars out
and that puru my mind
how cool is that
that's nothing special
it had no choice
it had no choice
i realized of course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get chance to mess it up
one of them got craalled up in the water
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach trmal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just stay home
so we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that god knows me
who wrote that
i tackged along with my neighbors
i'll meet you air
and i said to myself i want to get me one of that
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
bolly it matters a lot
he said what do you mean
he's a great guy you
so i'm not saying that saying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your job needs some challenging
the science is the
data drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated pack extracting technology from the logice company that i work for
but we're not there yet
you see there's a lot of things weic just don't have data
with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
it's a wing all around
it's a commnovate for bringing data into the humanitarian world
and that's a big deal for a profession that's in hidgh demand
and germany and friends
surely we know enough
four times the mass of the sun
we have to get quiet
you haven't earned it
how can we do it
there's a flip side as well
it is shocking to realize that only 28 of american
i will not forget the day we got that text message
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not to tellly one
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one's an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
who's got the event
i can use it in my company
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
ir reconcleilable difference is great
they supported me all the way through it
that's something we had to celebrate
since it gotten better
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something was wrong
the nazish invlated the netherlands
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
we'd love to help
blocks have names
we have no su bats
we took hamdon off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
i ran the campon police department because of that
and all of this matters are greatly because we're probably safety to me is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make their most critical decision
and at the op other end of the spectrum we're doing an inquallye terrible job
it impacts sentencing
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low levels to our cases on the streets just around the corner from our office detrusted
it impacts crime and violence
some people call it data science
and one of them said we had a rabbery two weeks ago
and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on the board
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i felt the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the arn noal foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have no suspects
now at that time camp d louw jersey was the most interst city in america
and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
their likes the baseball s down 20 years ago
it impacts everything
it worked for the oaken aase and it worked in the state of new jernsey
they're just waiting for their day and course
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
i'm de fans to 7 years old
and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a photo profile for your facebook
what about youu
i was going through a hard time as well
i was like whatat
this is the only part that's battery backed up
women's deals coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results will often surprise
i don't care
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
they don't represent what our views are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
his eonomy won't work and thomas jefferson saying the people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
do you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them tocribe
what makes the hard unique
i want to be the center of attention
why is it not working
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
did you heare here has gone mad
thank you very much
why not just let businesses compete
and then i thought this got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
yes it's hard
that's the status quo today
they can't get what they need when they need it
of just six people
just's the water stay there forever
quie the opposite
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype was set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
so why don't we leverage that
could we leverage the cloud
and that's the pass
we need portable health benefits
how should we work
it's about earning as much as possiblely can
how should we live
we need to reinvently porganizing
i would never want to do that
take a look at these
and we don't know that it's a home shelter
you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer  doiner are free
sort of leadership by humiliation
and i said where is he now
thanks for asking
and they're not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we imagine
but it's not enough
i've built a career
thank you very much
you spell money
we would to tolerate that
but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my beimi gun
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for freek
that didn't go over really well
we can open up city hall
i love building robots
what about manipulation
so that's mobile manipulation
and he wanted one and so badly
we can't identify with that part
that didn't happen to me
make it gooway
make a go it
make it go w
thank you very much
it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
but here's the thing
i don't know
and that's bad
it was a poem
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
my parents came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
so what was i going to do
that is the right answer
constan baker motley
how old are you
are the potential mide
are they attractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
i win there' six maybe should do that
so i changed my immediate coal to 10000 faces
what makes technology useful and usable
we have to turn that around
and that led me to this project
i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
so when the church is often is not clear
kind do they operate
why are we embedded in social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
so we have these feasts and famine cycles
so what do you think happens to theseig gals
well once again women get an angio gram and nob many can tell that they have a problem
and in fact it probably wants
we've done the research
they're often not recognized s at home
women are worth it
mortality is not going down it's going up
she had to impersonate a man
so thank you for your attention
he had told us about homeone replacement therapy
and not enough as being done about this
i'm not sure what it was
and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
you would be issuing orders from a boff
but in fact it found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
this is a real mystery
he was also the first person to call me a feminist
my brother's a lots interested as i am
he could come over and help me
how do you change your behavior
even that wasn't enough
some did not everybody
she wanted to change policy at the government level
we' the eat these cows
it's not inessry
it's not an option
they're not being shipped up peter
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
but it's not just china
we are the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own worlds
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just irack in afghanistan
i do believe we can fix what's broken
we all want to
he got part time
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history and it's the one that we have
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was the only way to get anything done
efficiency is for robots
human relationships are not efficient
that's available right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control o of these forces
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had to stuck and cover under her desk at school
but it's also an important date for another reason
but before that cooperation could be realized ennedy was assassinated and that part of the
maybe i didn an experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket science
to pick up the keys
i actually have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and pulling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military academy
that's the work that stands before us
it's an unconscious process
it's an authomatic process
we go out there and we cop in our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
in fact it's more like five percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
i don't have anything
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other for a sip of water
they were unexpected pleasures
or wherees he love
how much can we change
so when we met chock was the senior in high school
the question for us now is how much canid do we make of it
not a single one
i will be back
it's the warr on terral
but i love it for a totally different reason
they make sense of the past
but it wasn't just individuals
water contradiction
but it's different
this is not a put down of anyone
it's irresponsible
it is wrong
are we brave enough to welcome it
started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't ha
they need support
we had la enforceent progress
so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
it cracked open my world
his name is laonni hage and he's a veteran of vietnam
she would hide in the closet
they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
they want to know how often your dog gets outside
are you losing your mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem guy
so what happens next
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
why are' we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who was going to inherit his name and his fortune
he also had 11 children
not the wife not the kids
they should not have been surprised
please look at me
so no more messicing carsy
an option is actually not on the table
so it's up to us
but i would go in on occasion
and this routine went on for some time
and now i love numbers
most of my friendsre takking japanese
i was always very small
i know nothing
so water was something that scared me to begin with
so i thought why not punish myself
and this became my holy grouant and my rosotta stone
i tried everything
and i thought this would be great fun
i'm in tuzon
why was it amazed
it's a fucking orgine
they feel at home
how is it mize
make it about the other party
why don't we need to study this any more
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gas and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of the changing climate and our settled civilizations
imagine juggling a snowball across the topics
indeed we won the risk of making things worse
we' are seeing the baby's brain
there were others like myself who were full time
and he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not a dirty word
but those surveillance features come at a cost
government officials are extremely mad
i have to take a year off
i exist because i have my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
they grow crops
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity maneral woman
and this is crazy
i just disagree with this
i want to go
every kid lives near nature
there's pollination going on
there's people everywhere
that we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
and i was like oh the amazon
and i'm sure the figures are similar in other countries
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
the rituals were familiar
how could i come from the nation
what kind of rituals are these
one billion people
but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
i know it works
but i'm not happy
go one to my daughter
e if theie rice reallyy barlls
you might get a peace for that
so let's start there
i want to know how they impact me
i want to know how i impact them
and lots of money
this is great
it's the top credit
i'm not to be so healthy
upporting local economies
i made more money
we've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank
g a love red one
we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
we are you shir
so how do we do that
you say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in the day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working way more than full time cows
how else can we create new ideas
china is the world's greatest sanic poverty program over the last three decades
but some of our grandchildren probably will
it's natural connected tissue
can we really scale this up
then they had to bring them in
but you know what the actual facts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't right
without it we literally can't interface with others
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find the way to globalize democracy or
or any national leader
he wouldnt like the answer
they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have us
there would be invisible capacity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first t10 people to have this surgery
plus we have stem cells
and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child develop arutism
that was powerful
raise your hand
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake
it is about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry ong bag from the ground to the caras cell
and we couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing has grown in the city
you're in there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformation the climate transformations we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he sawed written down to me
that's sort of the state of the art
and now we want to do a double double of the age way of coming through
and so they took them to some safe place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what just happened to my brain
we now have a platform
and my whole world did open up
and who does that ben offit
i'm a professor and we are passionate about education
well we bought one of these
come on men
but there's actually more to the story than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how the molecules are put together
effectively the dalibar creat a complete blackout of any other sourcees of information
their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them fa
if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded
does any of us fatter
i'm not a military brat
one was to be a soldier the
they signed it because they wanted some form of avenge
the other w to be a baseball player
but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
prety cool
we have the plan
i am thinking of your love for me
pain runs through my body with the fires of my luve view
i am torn by you love for me
remember what i said my love
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
we might say then well let's not worry about this
that means at some point it's going to be your problem so
how does it happen
it was like a star trainpon
and that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of from monopoly
we can see everything on wikipedia
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is that possible
theyre going wrong it's not that we don't how my the mleice
they have bad ideas
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to getptter my job i just need to upgrade my browser
they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing a started business at all
because each year the winner has come from a different cribal group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need a serf toleectter
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i couldn't care myself away from the coverage
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
and others resented this comparison between gate rights civil rights and
we are looking for something more
i do like imagine
you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be the case
we can't change our minds
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
i got about 3000 e miles
my own website
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much potential
it' is about proving who you are and what you can do
broughten younger men
a i went back home and i said daddi i don't know who i am
and this is true
no one on lands had any idea that anything had gone wrong
you board the plane
the engine fails
the plane takes off
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
there were no back doors
how do you get to build those relationships
you just had a new thing sometimes
so we created a new school
and boor they were like what
but that doesn't mean that we can't
now that's a very very good point
we were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this is what i heard from a lot of outrahed people
the answer was no
this and how stuff is made memorable
and i got pretty into it
do you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
now i know why i'm here
well guess whaty
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of torauma am i talking about here
for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bit
and that's pretty amazing
but eventually they did come around
you are healer in a stonenge village
and so it wass perfect for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
they're not donated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
there is no other way
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience as it relates toementoring
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new productor service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
then we could make a mobile guiger couter
we can get volunteers
we drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of them
imagine if we had across the country right now in local places with
i have passion in my heart
it's just a wall
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
well not yet
has a coherent movement
look at this pretty structure
their faces broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when you see that
this will pay dividends
and in many cases we don't
but we all should
danaflies so often you won't even notice it
that wasn't the case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no more charged before youe
and then something falls off the wall
i can hurt the wight
only oneerc of the people are actually farmers
talk to farmers
so what can we do
who cares about ballnire
they don't get their money out
take my child
she worked in a bank
i believe it thiss story there has to be told
i have to report it
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
he was smiling and we said go
we've been working together since since we're kids really
whatich brought us to this
' don't too much sharing
it wasn't t who i was
here's where i stand
they don't have meaning
it's changed the way we talk
had no idea
the borard ofd
why don't they trust the low
they don't trust law
it's not true
weon't use audio we don't use fet dealth
so what to do next
but i need your help
what is that
she contacted anyone and everyone who was villting to buy my work
give me input
there's nothing underground about it
it's right there for you to find
we only sell you airtime
which means take my camera
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
i need things i'm saying take my picture
things were going well
why are we skipping over this
this is a really important chapion to me
i w understand this relationship
i went to the dans
you're doing an incredibly important work
and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walked across borders
one year i came up with a bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the words
you made it work for me
we know why kids don't learn
there's no need to play the market
i looked at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the global level in
how could i let them down
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
it's always what it was and what it can be
let us have a hong kong nearby
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
i wasn't very good at reading things
we're on the grin
thanks very much
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarce that are helpful
there won't be a single moment in the schedule
i don't paint
this is going to become really freaking and obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad guys
again it will not happen overnight
i mean everyone did
it needs to happen
is it heavy
let other people worry about it
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
where would it go
you can experience their sense of place
who would i meet
should i go there
the whole internet
i was looking for this thing that only fool seemed to look for
you can walk around them
they're all collective
so what is an idea drawing
and if it's completely ok what's the joke
here i'm one person talking to you
we just need to keep going
we don't need moore's law to continue
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artficial tealt
ian we have problems that we desperately need to solve
three billion people today with cell phones can't access internet
don't see the solutions to impress custimution
so what did they do
why is it important now
and not just that
they went together
and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
and let me just put this in context
and you know what else we din
and that's what we did
we met men where they were at and we built a program
why do i believe this
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of our spons
and i have to tell you i am passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still missing a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
this is your chance
which incidal is only a third correct
i don't mean giving up the internet
it is my belief that to create these rare game changes requires you to pull off at least
one you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
well you get several things
so they added oxygen to methane gas
the guas that they use at first in many cases with oxygen
and to do so we've had to believe and impossible things
that's what we do
you were born too
of those sevent have lucar weapons
but it's a global phenomenon
just think about it
it's very hard to get of course
we're going to stay with them forever
but that interface is beautiful
and does itt matter
i was talking a bit interaction design
designers asspired to be really great designers
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
you it's like once again there is this whole problem of design being often pesent a sooit for art
what we want what we aspire to is the coldest
i don't understand that
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deservees so much more
go i set again sweat forming on my brown
for africans homebrown science fiction can be a will to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
it is in the water
it was falsey and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
it's a marker of empathy
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language that's used by real people has them
texting has developed one from this slash
that's what texting is
and so how does your brain give you that detail
i know i have
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
it's using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
i'm totally serious
not what is it
they are the basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like commness and
well that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
when in the history of humanity has ever been possible for one person to rob what
they also monitored the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we're going down to the cellular level these days
i struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
what if i had told them my story years ago
after all i wasn't bit uninconventional
they have different interests
but it's not about fire in brindstone either
it means for youth and it's a new arab tv channel
there is an animated series and the works
and she's looking as young as ever
they have divergent values
through our nutrationionnal cameras
the economy needs them
i wanted to understand who takes the job
who cleans up after us
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project with them
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
and this leads to oddities
but this is the source of innovation
if we're still hungry we might have some more
we're not playing with each other
there's something a different ways to eat peta
but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to run you down
i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
i see now i never was one and not the other
i will not be plagued
one woman loses her head
face with absence
one woman feeds on trash
my spine curved spiral
one woman gives birth two borders
i will craft my own drum
thickness health tender violence
i live cycles of light and darkness
one woman strapped herself
where do refugee hrts go
cus the bombs left behind
one woman never did
we morn women complicated
one woman shoots her face
harvest contaminated to back ho
rhythm is havef silence
one woman gives birth to a baby
why not ask all of the states to do that instead
my father worked at his factory he said
my grandfather worked at this factory
and imagine what might happen because every reason has something to offer
that even small scale farmers can leverage
this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
it's about people
the net outcome
china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
we just need to act on it
well i didn't have any idea
it would be a mall and not a park
i had to have faith
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
how is that possible
they want their treatment
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
we are all responsible
but that's kind of a big problem
so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running draw
they would sit in them forever
how do i get through the hardest part
so momentum is good
and then what happens
often what happens is your're planning so hard for how do i get through the hardest party
not how much
or a fire fly
please sign here right now
it goes wrong
and it's powerful
why does a telly fisher mid life
it's more annoying
last week algone i got 238 pieces of nast to email and more
but i'm a big fan of news a person
that's more expensive
make me laugh
what are the researchers learning
i know i did it
so i was jealous
and i thin i'm a normal person
and i was really scared
but i found one
the irony is so obvious right
that's next to impossible
so i went into that direction
but that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
what is we dying for
i didn't know where i was
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
and this idea is actually nothing news
one way around this is to draw pictures
i started opening uanda
thank you f your time
i'll let you continue
we hope we bias
if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
well that' s what i thought
hartest your internal strength
we know that we are right and there are wrong
we have to throw it away
how can we get so much information out of so little motion
we push and pool and pok and breoth things
we would just get noise back
how sad are you right now
originally the example was aged 18 and 94
we take less notice of trivial matters
how frustrated are you right now
we know that every cell has a sex
but linda was lucky
we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum
but for too many women that's not the case
she found us we found her disease
the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
it showed no bloges
and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
and then we were alarmed to discover something
as an inventor i try and certain fantasy into reality
not when you get lung cancers
no plankton miss no fish
and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
actually studied hormones
and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
we can't see it most of the time
did you learn to wash your hands at home
so why is it
did you learn to wash your hands in school
why aren't people washing their hands
1836 people died
this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
you know they do pollls right
what about martin luther king
in fact south africa has not gone down that road
my life really sucks
life is great
it's the group shells
but we're not done yet
and you don't leave them wh they are
all of you are members of tribes
pretty much everybody else who does poluls
there was no road map
but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
you don't want this
but i don't
i don't know anybody
and he grew up essentially in stage one
it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
if you want this experience to live on as something historic then as the receptions
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
and i want to make the point that is members of society we need to
let's have dou
we don't trust themen
i do understand it
l's ever said that before
this' to debate about words about metaphors
i don't know
you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
doesn't happen very much
it has to stop
what about polio
and you know what
it brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohes
they were right
they had her scand inside out
we're losing a rich world
i teach at stanford
i would listen to the harts
this was when i was in texas
i'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology
and i felt all this
so i learned never to move
it would skip a beat
it would stop
it would start
we can do it again
and is this really dlution
when you grow up poor you want to be rich
getting a college education is a 20 year investment
now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
storytelling is so important
but what does
what would happen
stories are amazing
that wasn't being ask
what if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
she got unlucky
but you know what
but you know what
how far away was the finish line
i am fascinated by those times when people dousty eye to eye
so this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster
otherwise millions more will die
i even read many helf help books
i would love to hear from you
the first lesson is about humilityf
try it and let me know how it works for you
i we no
i am certainly not the hardest working
i was the first non family investor in name ison
it has never happened
i was a mediocre students
this is not sense
this is just one face of a booming sex trade crossed the arab region
but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
social change doesn't happen in the arab region through tramatic confrontation
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
by other great passion is the environment
so let's get started now
i was considered a radical
i was living in my own apartment
i was no longer harmess
i didn't always succeed
why are you really here
and i cried
i hadn't baded in three days
i was winning awards
would you like to create a second one to that
it's been thought about for a while
well i was surprised
i did not know this
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such brave 
some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a thirl
i am full of contradictions
i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
we have the right to respect
i want no part of any of that
i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman's feminism
it really is quite phenomenal
who or what inspires you and why
that's different from actually having an effective acp
5ent the day
how do is that procble
that is great
thank you very much
how much they do
what do they have
they have a common cold
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
do they have age
you make it flow under and over
i'm a fifth generation texan
what do you doing
i guess i'm doing it right now
your wife leuvt you
i study shame
why did you bring this up
she said yeah
and here is what you need to know
at what point did i think that was a good idea
have you lost your mind
i made a mistake
it's the best way to shut people down an airplane
he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
we shouldn't be nationalistic
well there's a st fulfilling prophecy
you learn more about how computer this work
but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read it write
he wanted to keep score
when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
what is it that he message me
some of them got out of the army and had tremendousychological problems when they got homees
how does that work
that's what's so complicated about war
it's not what i had expected
it was incredibly high
the boys are up there for a year
we have to answer that
they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead sceghly
and they don't need to ask for permission
that's my question
what's this guy talking about
let me illustrate this
this is completely desern
that's a terrible waste of time
do that only if you're paid by the oour
now do something differentow
that would not work
you're more cautcious
it is the default option
and you walk around and it points to things
you just move away
now hemilton was everything madison was not
first thing found this political parties
and they did it in the good old fashioned way
they change from person's person
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment
she was doing ok
that was her fight
she learned about her rice
75 of them are women and children
she got a support networks
now my own specialities combining digital technology and matgin
it's almuch becoming the syntex of a dual language
it turns out the evidence says otherwise
it's a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
young people as well
let's help them have a voice
and that's what we did
we can tell you with
the silent majority does not need to be silent
we hear the chaos of war
thank you very much
so they felt safe to come there
i said we work together
that's your grandfather
we didn't understand the programm
tell me badef that
they were all white
and work like a doll
and that's home
i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments and nonprofits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
this is possible
even want it so hard
that's what happened with my dad
they get scared to move
they get scared to walk around
my dan is alzheimer's disease
i'm trying to become a better person
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
they won the game
and the problem we worre solving is what are those things
so bear with me
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young
a digital world farm
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
why didn't you just tell me that
what can i learn with you
did you find the goal
so that was easy
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
we weren't considered the real thing
so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are trying out
so that's it for now
that's awful right
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
it's just incredible
i was sertrified
the same tool that united us to tople dictators
that's not to say it's impossible
growing up i was always intrigued by how people changed
againet's display
i don't look there f for ant up
that doesn't probably happen every day
now i'm ready for my interview
i needed an education
did i get my upgraght
we must adapt that way of giving back
i'm not sure
i would fright there with there
he's five years old
and i thought one of my thinking
it's not one way
and that's what i'm calling for here now
so you want to go to that board meeter but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
so what do we do
we almost don't feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
do the same thing it work
and so one of the major challenges of our projects really is to find photographs that we're taking before something
we said yes
we were so excited
agreeable people are warm and friendly e they're nice they playe
they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
the answer to that question is a very definitive
what are your attention toward others
it's all about what can use do for me
whereas giving it taking a more of your innermotives we your values
and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products
and we think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
let's think about your ethical footprint
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
he said a technology conference in plarida
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably won't
we have to fix the internet
most independent media would shut down
now don't get me wrong
of course they would
i could make that decision
that's not an im probleable sample
you know about number
you can navigate the space
you saw him at
maybe me feel smart
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
it was the coldest i've ever been
