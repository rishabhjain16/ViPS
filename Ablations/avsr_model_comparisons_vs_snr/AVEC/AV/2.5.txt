they want to be part of it
and they'd say i wouldn't work in glp povert but what would it mean about my careers
i don't know
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
well why is that
more difference ises they make if they talk like sars sign fell
well i want differences this make up
ow i will maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is good
the boys reminded me of home
it wasn't like them to mispractice
one perent you get to do that
i didn't want to
i said in arabic
after college i desperate we needed to find the polace to call home
they could knit the jackpot
look at the hand to see the animal
i'm in the crucipal right now
what is the abstraction
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on and opera all night long
that's what moves you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the wall
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of the anti reality tv
and it's hard and it takes currages but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so naturally i asked what he is african
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
it should be inspiring
how do you go for sure
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simethly critical to our eonomy
and i remembered we had experienced with this
in other words a corner could find these things because this' a fatal recipe
what can we do with all of us
roughly 300 s7ings and thos involved roughly 600 cenior visions
what do we need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
patriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
and guess what silicon valley
i've tried engaging people
and they also knew that they could happen to a workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people started contributing ideas
and that's actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
how toginner with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
w you train them however to adjust caution according to where they are
he wanted to say weere he could scan the room or into plan escape prouse we could get his hands
and that's exactly what that is
you remember calllos
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always tone to make it foster
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do this
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to the deceptions
there's no more ofer
so we did the analysis ing in a slightly different way
we paid 2 to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equation
sustainability has got to be a precompetitive issue
even if we get everybody's working on we've got to be srpeching
so was mother choice
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have a o of all
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it' is given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
again in a car
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
i was petrified
not a lot of hands
and when she went to complain to a major he said what
sexual harassments doesn't discriminate
they just do it
they all look the same as m it mean to a first approximation
well i think about this all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
and this has progressed
this is happening every day
they are looking and looking and finding love
what are you
i think this is a problem
beti's deels in boston
muchs more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like why did i really have to mold lonw
it's not that they didn't want me to think critically
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
well let's hold on to that louk for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
you've broken your back
the hear really knowledge
these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gass
we need to be part of a community to survive
isn itt about equality
we all know deep inside what the answer is
we've not since we were babies
i started looking at them really carefully
it's about systems
i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lock ourselves in the room for two days and we try to figure out what bound us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what it core values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brain to tune out with somebody else's issues
this meant that the movements demanding changed knew what they were against crushing poverty widen
well very often we think about political change in defined apartments the days
so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deeper
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just part of the same species
we part of the same family
i have three soughts so i see how they fight
and i won't name names but you know who you are
we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
we've all done this
win it's 10 degrees below zero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive joses of chemotherapy
she suffered so much
there's love and there's friendship and therese protection
could we merage
the question why does she stay
which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shin of future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one
he kept one in the gloved department of our car
and here's where those gess meen
i had just graduated from harvard college
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your co workers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
and when we're unprepared we overreact
they're not my children
and i did not know what to safe
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate location
on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should do
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11 o'clock they stoped talking about these little issues
you can try it
everything in neversweres out
and that purue my mind
how cool is that
that's nothing special
he had no choice
it had no choice
i realized of course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get chance to mess it up
one of them got callled up in the water
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach trmal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just stay home
so we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that god knows me
who wrote that
i tackged along with my neighbors
i'll meet you air
and i said to myself and i want to get me one of them
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
bully it matters a lot
he said what you mean
he's a great guy you
so i'm not saying that saying the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your dob isem challenging
the science is that
data drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated package straking technology from logic company that i worked for
but we're not there yet
you see there's a lot of things whic just don't have data are
with that you canally trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
it's a wind all around
it's a comment ev ae for bringing data into the humanitarian world
and that's a big deal for a profession that's in hide demand
and germany and friends
surely we know enough
four times the mass of the sun
we have to get quiet
you have't cn
how can we do it
there's a flip side as well
it is shocking to realize that only 28 of american
and will not forget the day we got that text message
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not to tellly one
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one's an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
who's that the event
i am use that in my company
whatever it is about that prison where they were born things like that
here reconsciitable differences right
they supported me all the way through it and
that's something we had to celebrate
this's got better
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something was wrong
the nazish invaded the netherland
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
we'd love to help h
blocks have names
we have no suspats
we took camp tocof the top of the list as the most intgerestity in america
i ran the campton police department because of that
and all of this matters are grazly because we're probably safing to me is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data wash by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on you the data and analytics to help make their most critical decision
and at the op other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
it impacts sentency
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low levels to our cases on the streets just around the corner from our office interesting
it impacts crime and violence
some people call it data science
and one of them said we had a grabbery two weeks ago
and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on the board
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i felt the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the arnal foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have no suspects
now at that time cambs lw jersey was the most interestity in america
and when i talk to judges around in the united states which i do all the time now they all see the same
their likes to bease most down 20 years ago
it impacts everything
it worked for the oken aide and it worked in the state of lutersey
they' are just waiting for their day and course
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
i'm de 2ed 7 years old
and we connected over really small thinges like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a photo profile for your facebook
what about youth
i was going through in hotd time as well
i'll like what
it's the only part of this battery backs up
womensairs coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results weill often surprise
i don't care
wealth it's ripped away from people who shouldn't be calledght unproductive
they don't represent what hard views are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
h anonommy won't work and thomas jefferson is saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
do you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at copying their national environment to get them to crive
what makes a heartdnatk
i want to be the sensit of attention
why did it not work
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
did you care here own man
thank you very much
why not just let businesses compete
and then i thought this got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
yes it's hard
that's the status o say
they kids that what they need when they need it
go of just six people
does the water stay there forever
quired the oposess
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype was set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have to
so why don't we leverage that
could we leverage the cloud
we that's the patch
we need portable health benefits
how should we work
it's about earning as much as you possibly can
how should we live
we need to reinvently porganizing
i would never want to do that
take a look at these
only we don't know that it's a homeess shelter
you don't have to bre any waters because the washherer drawing are free
sort of leadership by humiliation
he said where is he now
thanks for asking
and they're not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we imagine
but it's not enough
i've built a career
thank you very much
do you s spell money
we would tolerate that
so when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bam gun
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
that didn't go over really well
we can open up sitying hall
i love building robots
what about manipulation
so that's mobile manipulation
it didn't want want so badly
we can't identify with that parent
that didn't happen to me
make it gooway
we can go it
make it go in
thank you very much
it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
but here's the thing
i don't know
and that's bad
it was a poem
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
my parents came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of contentgion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
so what was that going to do
that is the right answer
constant baker malley
how old are you
if i did a position made
are the extractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
when there're six people to do that
so i changed my immediate calls 1000 faces
what makes technology useful and usable
we have to turn that around
and that led me to this project
i became a psychology researcher and i' devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
so when the church is often as aclar
how do they operate
why are we embedded in social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
so we have these feats and famine cycles
so what do you think happens to easic gal
once again women get the angi gram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
and in fact it probably wants
we've done the research
they're often not recognised that at home
women are worth it
mortality is not going down it's going up
she had to impersonate a man
so thank you for your attention
they had told us about hormone replacement therapy
and not enough as being done about this
i'm not sure what it was
and we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
you would be issuing orders from the boff
but in fact it found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
this is a real mst cream
he was also the first persesson to call me a feminist
my brother's a lot's interested i am
he could come over and help h
how do you change your behavior
even that wasn't enough
some did not everybody
she wanted to change policy at the government level
they eath these cows
it's not against
it's not an option
they' not being shipped up here
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking you
but it's not just china
we are the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own worlds
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just irack in afghanistan
i do believe we can fix what's protein
we all want to
he got part time
i'd forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history that's the one that we have
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was only way to get anything done
efficiency is for robotics
human relationships are not efficient
that's developable right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control of these forces
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had to duck and cover her under her desk at school
but it's also an important day for another reason
but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
maybe i didn't experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket science
to pick up the keys
i actually have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and pulling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military kemy
that's the work that stands before us
it's an unconscious process
it's an automatic process
we go out there and we cop in our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
in fact it's more like ive percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
i don't have anything
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other for a sip of water
they were unexpected pleasures
or wheres he left
how much can we change
so when we met chock with the senior in high school
the question for us now is how much can we make our
that a single one
i will be back
it's the warr on goome on
but i love it for it totally diive ourasem
they make sense of the past
but it wasn't just individuals
what a contradiction
but it's different
it's not have put down of anyone
it's irresponsible
it is wnd
are we brave enough to welcome it
started to walk in the community and d take a rocket sciences to realize that they wreon't have
they need support
we had law fulce suppgras
so they won't go for a while they won't hang out with their friends they won't need
it cracks open my world
his name is lonnieoj and he's a veteran vietnam
she was hide in closet
they want to know how much exercise your dog is getated
they want to know how often your dog gets outside
are you losing your mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem gu
so what happens next
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
why are't we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who was going to inherit his name and his fortune
he also had 11 children
not thewise not the kids
he should not have been surprised
please look at me
so no more messic a
caption is actually not on the table
so it's up to usk
but i would go in on occasion
and this routine went on for some time
and now i love numbes
most of my friend were takking japanese
i was always very small
and you've nothing
so water was something that scared me to begin with
so i thought why not punish myself
and this became my holy graim iros atta stone
i tried everything
and i thought this would be great fun
i'm in tuzon
why was it made
it's a fucking orgine
they feel at home
how is itmadz
may it about the other party
why don't weed to study this any more
what if the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate and our setbered civilizations
imagine juggling a snowball across the topic
indeed we won the risk of making things worse
we're seeing the bab's brain
there were others like myself who were full time
and he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not a dirty word
but those surveillance features come at a cost
government officials are extremely mad
i have to take year off
i exist because i have my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
they grow crops
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity maner woman
and this is crazy
i just disagree with this
i want to go
every kid lives near nature
there's pollination going on
there's people everywhere
and we involved on this planet in the contaxt of all the other animals with which we share
i was like oh the amazon
and i'm sure that the figures are similar other countries
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
the rginals were rebiliou
how could i come from a nation
what kind of rituals are these
one billion people
but the magnitude is the problem is something we need to appreciate
i know it works
but i'm not happy
don worant to my daughter
if theyi right wybldy
you might get a peace for that
a let's start there
i want to know how they impact me
i want to know how iigh impact them
and lots of money
this is great
it's the top credit
i'm going to be so healthy
u sporting local economies
i made more mindy
we've seen an image of our blue plant our world bank
got loveed redwark
we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
wh are you sir
so how do we do that
you say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in the day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working way more than full time cows
how else do we create new ideas
china is the world's greatstanndic poverty program over the last threew decades
i but some of our grandchildren probably will
it's natural connected tissue
can we really scale this up
then they had to bring them in
but you know what the aal facts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't right
without it we literally can't interface with others
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
or any national indter
he wouldn like the answer
they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
the simplem important has falling way down from what it used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have us
there would be invisible capacity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first t10 people to have the surgery
because we have stem cells
and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child developolritism
that was the power oful
rae your hand
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the heating earthquake
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the caris cealf
and we couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing hustroonei is
you're in there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformation the climate transformation we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw it written down to me
that's sort of the state of the irt
and now we want to do a double double of the age way of coming through
and so they took them to some safe place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what's it happen to my brain
we now have a platform
and my whole world did open up
and you does that beenter thing
i'm a professor and were passionate about education
well we bought one of these
gabon men
but there's actually more to the story than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how molecules are put together
effectively the dali bolaryate a complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them fa
if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanding
does any of us fatter
i'm not a military raat
one was the be a soldier the
they signed it because they wanted some form of avenge
the other was to be a baseball player
but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
pretyoo
we have the plan
i am thinking of your lf for me
pain runs through my body with the fires of my lutch few
i am torn by you love for me
remember what i set my life
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
we might say then well let's not worry about this
that means at some point it's going to be new problem to you
how does it happen
it was like a star tink person
and that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of monopolies
we can see everything in wikipedia
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is that possible
n going wrong it's not like we don't have my milice
they have bad ideas
then she gets the bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better my job i just need to upgrade my brotsers
they know you can fail by starting a business to goes bankrupts or by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winnow has come from a different cribal group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need a search a lesson
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i couldn't care myself away from the coverage
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
and others resented this comparison between gate rights civil rights and
we're looking for something more
i do like magic
you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be the case
we can change our minds
they're completely fla and they're basically cardboard characters
i got about 3000 e mils
my own website
so since then i've been the pression a lot of people have woralked over me
but there's so much potential
it's about proving who you are and what you can do
brought in younger men
a i went back home and i said dad yea i don't know who i am
and this is troue
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
you bored the plane
the engine fails
the plane takes off
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
there were no badck doors
how do you get to build those relationships
you just had a new thing sometimes
so we created a new school
and boy they were like what
but that doesn't mean that we can't
now that's a very very good point
we were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this is what i heard from a lot of out raich people
the answer was no
this isn't how stuff's made memorable
and i got pretty into it
do you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
now i know why i'm here
well guess what
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of toraum am i talking about here
for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bit
and that's prettymazing
but eventually they did come around
you are healer in a stonige village
and so let's putfect for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
they're not donated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just a self expression
there is no other weay
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new productor service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
then we could make a mobile tigger cgeter
we can get volunteers
we can drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of them
imagine if we had across the country right now in local places but
i have passion in my hearts
it's just a wall
both of them bring the imaginations to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
well not yet
has a coerant movement
look at this pretty structure
their faces broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will pay dividnds
and in many cases we don't
but we all should
danaflies so often you won't even notice it
that wasn't case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no more charged before youe
and then something falls off the walk
i can turn the way
only oneerc of the people are exceent farmers
talk to farmers
so what can we do
who cares about posnia
they don't get their money out
take my childn
she worked in a bank
i believe it's a story there has to be told
i have to report it
so the very first thing we wanted to do and this building was look at the air system
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
hear was smiling and we said go
we've been working together what since we're kids really
which brought us to this
you don't do much sharing
it wasn't who i was
here's where i stand
they don't have meaning
changed the way we talk
had new idea
the ponint ofvent
why don't they trust the lag
they don't trust the law
it's not true
we don't ussult you we don't use feteelth
so what do to do next
but i need your help
what is that
she contacted anyone and everyone who was vitting to buy my work
give me input
there's nothing underground about it
it's right there for you to find
we only sell you airtime
which means take my camera
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
and he thinks i'm saying to take my picture
they will well
why are we ipping over this
this is a really important chaption to me
i want to sta in this relationships
i went to the things
you're doing an incredibly important work
and so many of my early memories involved intricate staydreams where i would walked across borders
one year i came up with a bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the words
you made it work for me
we know why kids don't learn
there's no need to play the markets
i looked at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the global level
how could i let them down
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
it's always what it was and what it can bean
let us have a hong kong nearbye
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
i wasn't very good at reading things
we're on the grid
thanks very much
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scared to the help
there won't be a single moment in the schedule
i don't paint it
this is going to become really freaking obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad guys
again it will not happen overnight
i mean everyone did
it needs to happen
is it heavy
let other people worry about it
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
where would it go
you can experience their sense of place
who would i mean
should i go there
the whole internet
i was looking for this thing that only fool seemed to look for
you can walk around them
you're all collective
so what is an idea droying
and if it's completely ok what's the doke
here i'm one person talking to you
we just need to keep going
we don't need more to lag to continue
i think we need something like a manhattan project on this topic of artificial stas
i we have problems we desperately need to solve
three billion people to pay with cell phms cant aect connect
don't create solutions to impress contimution
so what did they do
why is it important now
and not just that
they weet together
and he was talking about the importance of coaching boyses and men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
and let me just put this in context
and you know what else we did
and that's what we did
we met men where they were at and we built a program
why do i believe this
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of our spots
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still missing a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertiseming council and we asked them to help us
this is your chance
which insi is only a third correct
i don't mean giving up the internet
it is my belief that to create these rare game changes requires you to pull off that these
what you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
well do you get several things
and so they added oxygen to methane gas
the gas that they use at first and manyications with oxygen
and to do so we've had to believe and impossible things
that's what we do
who were born to
of those sevent have nuclear weapons
but it's a global phenomenon
just think about it
it's very hard to get of course
we're going to stay with them forever
but that interface is beautiful
and doesn itt matter
i was talking bit interaction toesige
designers asspired to be really great descinist
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
it's like once again there's the whole problem of design being often psent a suit for art
what we want what we aspire trees are coldest
i don't understand them
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserve so much more
go i set again sweat forming on my brown
for african homegrown science fiction can be a will to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political righting
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
it is in the water
it was faulty and most of the time i had to be started over and over before it worked
it's a marker of empathis
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language that' used by real people has them
texting has developed one from this slash
that's what texting is
and so how does your brain give you that detail
i know i have
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
iss using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
i'm totally serious
not what is it
they are the basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like commness and
well that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we're going to go even deeperth than the human body
when in the history of humanity has ever been possible for one person to rab what
they also monitore the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we're going down to the cellular level these days
i struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
what if i had told from my story years ago
after all i wasn't bit unconventional
they have different interests
but it's not about fire and brinstone either
it means for youth and it's a new arab tv chann
there is an animated series in the works
and she's looking as young as ever
they have divergent values
there are no external cameras
the economy leads them
i wanted to understand who takes the job
who cleans up a for us
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project with them
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
and this leads to ouditence
but this is the source of innovation
if we're still hungry we might have some more
we're not playing with each other
there's something different ways to eatiza
but if you won't move we'll have no choice but it'll run you down
i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
i see now i never was one and not the other
i will not be plainued
one woman les her head
face with absence
one woman feed on trash
my spine curved spiral
one woman gives birth two borders
i would draft my own drum
thickness health tender violence
i live cycles of light and darkness
one woman strapped herself
where do refugee harts go
clust their bombs left behind
one woman never did
we moreorn women complicated
one woman shoot her face
harvest contaminated tobato
rhythm is have silence
one woman gives birth to a baby
why not ask all of the states to do that instead
my father worked at this factory he said
my grandfather worked at this factory
and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
that even small scale farmers can leverage
this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
it's about people
the net outcome
china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
we just need to act on it
well i didn't have any idea
it would be a mall and not a park
i had to have faith
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
how is that possible
they want their treatment
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
we are all responsible
but that's kind of a big problem
so after 25 years i began the field as though i was running dry
they were sitting them forever
how do i get through the hardest part
so momentum is good
and then what happens
often what happens is your planning so hard for how do i get through the hardest part
or not how much
or a fire flying
please sign here right now
it goes wrong
its powerful
why does't getlly fisher ment life
it's more anoying
last week agone i got 238 pieces of nats to email and more
but i'm a big fan of news a person
that's more expensive
make me laugh
what are the researchers learning
i no i dida
so i was jealous
and i think i'm the normal person
and i was really scared
but i found one
the irory is so obvious right
that's next to impossible
so i went into that to action
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
what is we dying for
i didn't know where i was
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
and this idea is actually nothing news
one way around thiseds to draw pictures
he started goping u ganda
thank you your time
i'll let you continue
we all be biased
if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
well that' s what i thought
hardest your internal strength
we know that we are right there are wrong
we have to throw it away
how can we get so much information out of so little motion
we push and pool and pok and both things
we would just get noise back
how'm sad are you right now
originally sample was aged 18 to 94
we take less notice the trivian matters
how frustrated are you right now
we know that every cell has a sense
but linda was lucky
we have the tools but we lack the collective will and moment
but for too many women that's not the case
she found us we found her disease
the authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
it's showed no blockges
and it's an issue of the quality and the inthegrity of science and medicine
and then we were alarmed to discover something
as an inventor ice tran turned fantasy into reality
not when you get lung cancers
no planon miss no fish
and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
actually studied hormones
and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplantce
we can't see it most of the time
did you learn to wash your hands at home
so why is it
did you learn to wash your hands in school
why aren't people washing their hands
1836 people died
this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
know they do pa right

in fact south africa has not gone down that road
my life with the socks
life is great
it's the group shells
but we're not done yet
and you don't leave them wh they are
all of you are members of tribes
pretty much everybody else who does pollls
there was no road map
but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
you don't want this
but i don't
i don't know anybody
and he grew up essentially in stage one
it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people tribe about how
if you want this experience to live on as something history that as the reception
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
and i want to make the point that is members of society we need to
let's have down
we don't trust a themen
i do understand it
h ever said that before
this is debate about words about metaphors
i donn't know
you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
doesn't happen very much
it has to stop
what about brio
and you know what
it brings people together and supports creativity and social cohesion
they were right
at her scand inside of
we're usosing a ritual
i teach at stanford
i would listen to the harand
this was when i was in texas
i'm physician practicing with cutting edge technology
and i felt all this
so i learned never to move
it would skip a be
it would stop
it would start
we can do it again
and is this really is soitlutional
when you go por you want to be rich
getting a college education is a 20 year investment
ow in all serious sense movies are actually really important
storytelling is so important
but what does
what would happen
stories are amazing
that wasn't being acid
what if obesity isn't the cause of insulant resistance at all
youe got unlucky
but you know what
but you know what
how far away it was the finish traine
i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye
so this is not this slogan from an inspirational poster
otherwise millions more will die
i even read man his helf help books
i would love to heare from youon
the first lesson is about humanity
try it and let me know how it works for you
c ght no
i'm certainly not the hardest working
i was the first non family investor nameson
it has never happened
i was in media ofal students
this is not sense
this is just one face of a booming sex trade cross the arab region
but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
myy the great passion is the environment
so let's get started now
i was considered a radical
i was living in my own apartment
i was no longer harmess
i didn't alway succeed
why are you really here
and i cried
i hadn't baged in three days
i was witning awards
would you like to create a second one to get
it's been thought about for a while
when i was surprised
i did not know this
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravee
some boys broke me what i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break at g all
i am full of contradictions
i'm a fembinist but i'm a rather bad one
i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
there are gorgeous and head strong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
we have the right to respect
i want no part of any of that
i learned to wite like them and then i learned to write as myself
we go far beyond reasonable and constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman's feminism
it really is quite phenomenal
whoill walk inspired you and why
that's different from actually having an inffective acp
5 the day
how is that possible
that is great
thank you very much
how much they do
what do they have
they have a common cold
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
you think of age
you make it flow hunnder and over
i'm a fifth generation texton
what do you doing
i guess i'm doing it right now
who wife levt here
i study shame
why is you bring this up
she said yanna
and here's what you need to know
at what point did i think that was a good idea
have you lost your mind
i made a mistake
it's the best way to shut people down an airplane
he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
we shouldn't be nationalistic
where there's a def fulfilling prohecy
you learn more about how comput this work
but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read it writ
he wanted to keep sore
we you really look at how is it the young people spend most of their time us to do technologies
what is it that he message
some of them got out of the army and had tremendous pychological problems when they got home
how does that work
that's what so complicated about war
it's not what i had expected
it was incredibly high
the boys are up there for a year
we have to answer that
they're too busy putting out daily fires so think it had this fhatically
and they don't need to ask for permission
that's my question
what's this like talking about
let me illustrate this
this is completed a go
that's a terrible wasek of time
so that only if you're paid by the hours
now it is something different that
that would not work
you're more conacious
it is the default option
and you walk around and it paints the things
you just move away
now emilton was everything madisone was noto
first they've doun these political parties
and they did it in the good old fashed way
they changeed from person supporton
so it's more about tapturing an idea than about capturing a momentring
she was doing ok
that was her fight
she learned about her rice
75 of them are women and children
she died as support networks
we all specialities combining digital technology and bages
it's almost becoming the syntax of a dual language
it turns out the evidence takes otherwes
it's a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
young people as well
let's help them have a voice
and that's what we did
we can tell you with
the syn of thejorityes does not need to be siled
been the chos of war
thank you very much
so they felt safe to come there
i said we work together
that's your grandfather
we didn't understand the program
don't be a benter thing
they were all white
and work like a doll
and that's allome
i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments and nonprofits have delivery arments that are fully capable of covering this what
this is possible
even one it's so hard
that's what happened with my dad
that get's kind to move
they get scared to walk around
my dan is alzheer's disease
i'm trying to become a better person
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
they want the game
and the problem worth solving is what are those things
so bear with me
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young
i digital world farm
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
why didn't you just tell me that
what can i learn with you
he's find a goal
so that was easy
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
we weren't considered the real thing
so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are trying out
so that's it for now
that's awful right
and one act ofv this actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
it's just incredible
i was certrified
the same tool that united us to trople dictators
that's not to say it's impossible
growing up i was so was intrigued by how people changed
againet's display
i don't look diff for up
that doesn't probably happen every day
now i'm reading from my interview
i need it an education
did i get my upgraght
we must adapt that way of giving back
i'm not towd
i would right there with there
he's ive years old
and i thought what am i thinking
it's not one way
and that's what i'm calling for here now
so you want to go to that board meeter but you only want to pay attention to the best that interest
so what do we do
we almost don't feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
do the same thing at work
and so one of the major challenges of our projects really is to find photographs that we're taken before something
we said yes
we were so excited
agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice theyre polite
they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
the answer to that question is very definitive
what are good attention toward others
it's all about what can use you for me
whereas eivening it taking a more of your intermotives with your values
and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers thatid i would never sell them one of our crappy products
and when we think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
let's think about your ethical footprint
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
he said a technology conference in plorida
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably woe
we have to fix the internet
most independent media would shut down
now don't get me wrong
of course they would
i could make that decision
that's not an a probleable tumple
you know about number
you did navigate space
you saw him at
it made me feel smart
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
i don't even know it's a real jobsitle be honest
it was the coldest i've ever been
