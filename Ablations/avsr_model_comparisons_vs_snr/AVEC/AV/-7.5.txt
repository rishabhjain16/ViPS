so we lock ourselves in the room for do d that and we try to figure out we're about us together
well we rejected all of that
we looks like what it feels like and most of our what value
especially when it comes to climate dange
but in the process they also train our brain do down what somebody else do
the movement depending changed what they were crathing poverty one

i think it might be a lifeline
that last one an actual tex message that we received

we should came to off the top of the lasay the was interested in amican
i reran the name to police department because of that
and all of thisse matters are crazy because we're probably saveomething the most important function of the
but what you started to look at the data was by the way the judes don't have when we look to look at the data
so i decided to focus on to to help make their most crital decision
and at the opother the spectrum were doingqu terrible job
impact teentc
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level trein dates and the street justerfic order from our office interest
in about crime violence
some people call it dacitites
and one of them is said we had grabmy twoeks ago
and they would sakell they would rit them they would pore up on the board
they haven't yet been confinced of the crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensiveminter they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justic system in the united statesday i felt the that same way that i think about theateive
when i started maicchure'm to found i came imagin lot of this questions and i came back
we have no d expect
now at that time came lutert was the most interesting america
and when i talk to jud around the united states which i do all the time now they c all see the same
they're led a patbel down 20 years ago
he impacks everything
it worked for the old das and work in the date of luturetam

i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to e for that to make substantial progress
weould sch
i don't thin
wealth it's ripped away from people be caught up productive
they don't represent the work on a fut sory
we got to the battle betweenm
won't worry i'm cheff people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all

we have idea for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
we draw the plank and it wasn'ting wrong
i do believe we f what's bren
we all want to
it got part time might
i forgive you and i do want hate you
but what we have
how did you find it notchool

how do we gre to this
chin will try sec a profit program over the last for decades
some of probly
thiss natual connective issue
w really sll some
they any point to me
but you know what the act with fat are
but now it's turned around
i get terby
my history wasn't right
without me really dfaed with others
my was very powerful
and it's important
we can only think of one way
we're talking about the values with those public spaces where we come together
the world and let we find a way to global liized pop or

and we're
would
wait out what you should be
we need doate a global parliament of parirs

a neuge opportunity and potential for innovation for development
but the question who will laugh as
they wre be invisible
of course my crdes would become even more important
and the change getting more wrapid
i know i was oneond the first that people have
because we have toam t
realzed it wor
i was able do more

we how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformations climate transmit we have to decide to do
i look at that pattern
it's notght of acoubtable
thats sort of this thing of the gy
now we want to do a doublep of the ege way of coming through
so they turn them seem saf place
a how
in fact what my brin
we now have plan form
and myome
i
i'm a professor repasion about educ
