they want to be part of it
and they say i want to work global povert but what would it mean about my career
i don't know
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for burnetors
we why is that
what differences that make it they talk about like dorry sig fell
what what different stiddents make
now i will maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is good
the boys reminded me a homeem
it wasn't like them to mispractice
1 pcent we get to do that
i didn't want to
i said in arabic
after college i desperately needed find a place to call home
sav to his a jack part
look at the end is to the animal
i'm in thecruscial right now
what is the abstract che
you don't quest you that
it's so obvious
and they put on an ofk we all night long
that's what needs you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the world
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
the kind of the anti reality tp
and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famless
how are we going to do that
so naturally i asked what is after
and it does't
it took six days to deploy a global mal whar campaign
it should be inspiring
how do you know for sure
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply critical for our com
and remember we had experience with this
in other words a corner to find these things to gift to take patal effs
what can we do in all of us
roughly 300 savings and loans involved roughly 600 s years a
what do you need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
hatriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm the survivor of all forms of sexual views including through
and guess what silicon valley
i tried engaging people
and they also knew that they could tap into a workforce
don're not
but people could not relate with this
people started constributing ideas
and that s actually what happened
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
out toginner with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
we do train them however to adjust how she according to where they are
he wanted to sit wh he could scan the room where he could plan esate roup wh he could get his hand
and that's exactly what that is
youmem to call us
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always trying to make it faster
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them satfici
there's no more of it
so we did the analysis again a slightly differently
we pay two to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equations
sustainability h got to be a pre comompetitivevission
even if we get everybody's working on it it's got to be strategic
so was mother toursaid
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have an overoo
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it's given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve class
you don't get the same witnesses of their positions
again in a car
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shames
i was petrified
not a lot of hands
and when she went to complain to a major he said what
sual harisment don'tiscriminate
they just do it
say all looks the same with their mind i mean to a first a foxination
what i think about this all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
and dayas had progressed
and he's happening every day
they're looking and looking and finding more
how are you
i think this was a problem
beefisiels in boston
f'ch more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teaith
like why did i really have to move on
and it's not that they didn't w me to critically
you can't run around ino the darkn
what can i do about it
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about its
you'll never walk again
well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mil to be thrown away
and you're prorop in your back
the key here really acknowledge
these guys could be true to their purpose is finding oil and gas
we need to be part of a community to survive
isn't about a quality
we all know de inside with the answer is
we've been all says we were babies
i started looking at them really carefully
is it about systems
i looked at my friend who driiled sezen dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decisions
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous curs
so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what found us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its foor values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brain to chune out when somebody else's issues
this meant that the movements demanding chanin knew what they were against crushing poverty widely
well very often we think about political change and defines compartners the gas
so i want to talk to you today about when i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
a couple of years ago a group of us canada decided that we were hitting the limit of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just far of the same species
we're fart of the same family
i have freeesoughts so i see how they fight
and i won't name names but you know who you are
you see it as a disruption of real life and important work
we've all done this
when it's 10 degrees flow zero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patiation with massive doses of chemotherapy
and she suffered so much
its love and their friendship and their is protection
could we merge
the question why does she stay
which is why that i belieg agree and the wall steret job in this great shiny teacher
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trafh disguised asis love one
he kept one in the global compartment of our car
and here's where those guns commnd
i had just graduated from harvard college
show of used the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to speak
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds gree until you figure out where it's really going
and when we are unprepared we overact
they're not my children
and i did not know what to saf
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
on the other hand statistics that's a subject that she could and should use
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11'clock they stoped talking about these del isiones
you can try it
everything in the universe worres out
and that blew my mind
howful is that
that's nothing special
again it had no choice
it had no choice
i realize of course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last few want
you don't get a chance to mess it up
one of them got caued up in the water
my mother was on the line tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just stay home
but we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that god knows you
he wrote that
i talked along with my neighbors
on meet you there
and i said to myself i want to get me one of them
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
boy mat of a lot
he said good need
you was a great guy
so i'm not saying that saying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your job needs to be challenging
the science is there
data drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistic company that i work for
but we are not there yet
you see there's a lot of things that just don't have data on
with that you can actually trigger aight funds the four crisis can happen
it's a win all around
a coming of age to bring us data into the humanitarian world
and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand
and germy and friends
surely we know enough
four times the message for sun
you have to get quiet
you have't earned it
what can we do it
there's a flip side as well
it's shocking to realize that only 28 of american
i will not forget today we got that text message
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not to tell anyone
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one's an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so is that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hp line
who's up the is then
i can use it in my company
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
you'll reconcile lt differen to right
they've supported me all the way through it
that's something we had to celebrate
sus got better
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something is wrong
the nazish infaded the netherlands
when i get out of this am i going to getrjected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
we'd love to help
locks happiness
we have no suspect
we took camvon off the top of the list as the most danger city in america
i ran the candon police department because of that
and all of this matters greatly because public safey to me is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on youving data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
and at the off other end of this fectum we're doing a comly terrible job
it impacts sentencing
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases of the streets just around the quarer from our office to turn for
it impacts crime and violence
some people call it dada science
and one of them said we had a robery two weeks ago
and they would take a yeow sticke and they would brit something on it and they would put it up on a pin
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
we have no suspects
now at that time hebvon new jersey was the most diiversity in america
and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
do like the baseball s step 20 years ago
it impacts everything
it worked for the openinges and it works for the sustain of futurs in
they're just waiting for their daying for
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
and 207 years of
and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a photo profile for your facebook
how about you
i was growing through a hard time as wll
i' was like what
it was the only part that battery backed up
wom' veers coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make a suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
when we do the results will often surprise
i don't care
wealth it's ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
they don't represent what our views are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamelton
this economy won't work and thomas jeffersons saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
but do you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to drivee
what makes the hard unique
i want to be the center of potential
why is it not working
this is what i'm suosed to naturally be able to do
did you care he are gone madh
thank you very much
why not just let vistuses compete
and then i thought thiss got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
y it's hard
lets start a slot today
they can't get what they need when they need it
aaga just fif people
there the water stay there forever
we quie the opposite
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
so why didn't we leverage that
could we leverage the cloud
or that's the pass
we need portable health beneits
how should we work
it iss about earning as much as a possily can
how should we live
we need to reinvent labor organiz it
i would never want to do that
take a look at these
only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
we don't have to bring any quders because the washering dire are free
sort of leadership by humiliation
and he says where is he now
thanks for askking
and they are not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we imagined
but it's not enough
i built a career
thank you very much
do you fell much
we would a tolerate from
but when i was little i remember he would kill flides in our house with my vva guns
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
that didn't go really well
we can open up city hall
i love building robots
what about manipulation
so that's mobile manipulation
and he wanted one so badppy
we can't identify with that perss
that didn't happen to me
it made a go weay
it ma could go away
make it gow
thank you very much
it's nally teaching them how to ride a bike
but here's the thing
i don't know
and that's bad
it was a poem
we're going to start putting an entire layer digital information on the real world
my parent came from germanyation
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of compagion and they wouldn't even walk in front ofe
so what was i going to do
that is the right answer
constant fare my
i'm old are new
are they from me
i the attractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
revn't six m ab throu that
so i changed my immediate cal de teendal the faes
what makes technology useful and usable
we have to turn that around
and that led me to this project
i became a psychology researcher and i devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for other
so when the church is ofpten as i could
how do they operate
why are we embedded social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
as how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
so we have these keyce and samnding cycles
so what do you think happens to these a gals
they once again women get the angrograms and nobody can tell that they have a problelic
and in fact it probably wong
we've done the research
they arere often not recognized that's homem
women are working
mortality is not going down it's going up
he had to impersonate a man
so thank you for your attention
itsld its aboutform and we placement therapy
and not enough is being done about that
i'm not sure what it was
i would like to think it's not going to take 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which is about building goods and products and now we have a service
you would be issuing orders from a bos
but in fact they found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
this is a real myesserary
he was also the first pesson to call me a femalists
my brothers a lot as interested as i am
he could come over and help me
how do you change your behavior
even that with a
some good not everybody
she wanted to change palicy at the government level
we're going to eat these cows
it's not a genture
it's not optual
they're not going to ship that feld
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been a pleasure speicky to you
but it's not just china
where are the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things stter and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own ways
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just the iraq in afghanistanage
i do believe we can fix what's broken
we all want you
he got hard time i
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history as the one that we have
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality is not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological records
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was only way to get anything done
efficiency is four of robots
human relationships are not efficient
that's the dealbleill right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control of news houses
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had to duck in cover under her desk at school
but it's also an important date for another reasons
but before that cooperation could be realized hennedy was assassinated and that part of me
maybe i didn't experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket fan
'll pick up the keys
i should have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and fulling with this object
my research even and i went to west point military academy
that's the work that stands before us
it's an unconscious process
it's an automatic process
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
in fact it's more like 5 percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
i don't have anyy
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other forirst fip of water
do unexpected pleasures
or where sh hee left
how much cany changge
so when we met chuck with a senior in high school
the question for us now is how much can we make of it
not a single one
i will be back
it's the war on ceror
but i love it for a totally different reason
they make sense of the patt
but it wasn't just i the bid was
what a contridiction
but it's different
it is not a foot down of anyone
it is irresponsible
it is wrong
are we frave enough to welcome it
started to walk in the community and didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they were
they need support
we had lawnful confers
so they w't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
it cracked open my world
his name is wuanne hamak and he was the veteran of vietnam
he would hide in a closet
they want to know how much exercise their job is getting
s they want to know how often do all gets outside
are you losing your mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem di
so what happens next
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
he also had 11 children
not the wife not the kids
he should not have been surprised
please look at me
so no more messing gas
that option is actually not on the table
so it's up to us
but i would go int about occasion
and this routine went on for some time
and now i love h
most of my frindsre taking japanese
i was always very small
i nothing
so water is something that scared me the beginning
so i thought why not punish myself
and this became my home groum and i was at a sta
i tried everything
can i thought this should be great fun
i'm in to sonns
why w was it made
it's a fucking orugy
they feel at home
how is it made
nak it about the other pur
why don't needis study this anymore
what is the exact relationships between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate in our settled civilizations
imagine juggling a snowball across the conficce
indeed we run the risk of making things worse
we are seeing the baby brain
there were others like myself who worth full times
and he' was a bad guy
the children were killed on the splot
it's not a dirty word
but those surveillance features coming acroosts
government officials are extremely mad
i have to take a your arm
i exist because i had my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
they grow crps
and so i think that nature is not that which is unntouched by humanity manal one
and this is crazy
i just disagree with that
i want to go
every kid lives in your nature
there's colonation going on
there's people everywhere
like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals who wish we share
i was like oh the amavon
and i'm sure the figures are s or other
you've just somehow forgotten how to see it
the rituals wereth nowion
how could i come from the nation
what kind of rituals are these
one billion people
that the magnitude of the follow is something you need to appreciate
i know it works
but i'm not happy
i w to my daughter
zipat i write very well
you might get a peace for that
let's start dn
i want to know how they impact me
i want to know how i impact fama
lots of money
this is great
s the top creditor
but i'm going to be so healthy
40 local economs
i read more moneght
we've seeed an image of our blue planet or world bank
on love reyone
we don't even need that a timran to be amazing things
yet when she hadas to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
why you sa
so how do we do that
you say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in a day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
how else can we create new ideas
china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
but some of our grandchildren probably will
it's natural connective tissue
can we really scale this up
then they have to bring them in
but you know what the actual facts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't right
without it we miterally can't interface with others
my desire to disappear is still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
for any national leader
he wouldn't like the answer
they were arguing with one another about access to the holly sites
the supreme cour has fallen way down from what it's used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have it
there will be invisible capacity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first ten people to have this surgery
becausest we have stem cells
and when i was pen0 i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child develop autism
that is powerful
raise your hand
it's actually not that hard
we law valuable data
that was a huge problem at the haiti earth place
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the caryffcelf
and we couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing has grown the city
you're in there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transmlation the climate transformations we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw it written down toway
that's sort of the state of the art
and now we want to do a double fouveble of the age wave coming through
and so they took them to some sake place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what did happen to my brain
we now have a platform
and my whole world did open up
and who does that benisf it
i'm a professor and who're passionate about education
we bought one of these
come on man
but there's actually more to the stories than thatck
the oil will never run out
what's different is how the molecules are put together
effectively the taliban create a complete blacku of any other source of information
their parents are so pold they have no resources to get them back
if any child is found violating he jews he is severely repomimmended
does any of this matter
i'm not a military rack
one was to be a soldier
they signed it because they wanted us some horm of benge
the other w be a baseball plan
but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
pretty coo
we have the plan
i am thinking of you' lu for me
pagrins through my body with the fires of my bood for hums
i am torned by the 11
remember what i said my love
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
we might say then well let's not worry about this
i mean at some point it's going to be your problem to
how does it happen
it was like a stark
and that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
pypically a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of monopoly
we can see everything on wikipedia
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how itself possible
so' go berong's like don't have comedy theeiet
they have thatad ideas
then she gis the bosses to reate how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get bet of my job i just upgrade my browsers
they know you can fail by starting a business that go bankrnd or by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winter has come from a different trival group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need to circuate acc
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i couldn't tare myself away from the coveoard
african americans supported it at a higher level than have ever been reported
and others presented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
we are looking for something more
i do like magic
will you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be case
we can change our own minds
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
i got about 3000mils
from my own website
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much potential
it's about moving who you are and what you can do
brought in younger men
and i went back home and i said thatadya i don't know who i am
and b is ru
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
you board the plane
the engine fails
the plane take that off
they dreamed of a variety of horrifying scenarios
there were no back doors
how do you get to build those relationships
you just had a new thing sometimes
so we created a new school
and boy they were like what
but that does't mean that we can't
that's a very very good point
we were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this is what i heard from a lot of outlrage people
the answer was no
this is how stuff is made memorable
and i got pretty into it
you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
now i know why i am here
well guess what
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of tm am i talking about here
for hepatitis it was also 2 and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
but imagine you're walking in the forest and youke a ba
and that's pretty amazing
but eventually they did come around
you are hereer in a stoneyach village
and so it's perppet for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
you're not donated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i' thought poetry was just self expression
there's no other way
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience as it relates cementering
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral talen that is in the tradition of other st that we have
this is a crisis that's getting worst day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new productor service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
ok then we can make a mobileiger counter
you can get volunteers
you drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of ms
imagine if we had across the country right now in multile places that you
i have passion in my part
it's just a wal
those of them bring the imagination to life and ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
well not yet
has a coherent movem
look at these pred structures
their faces broadcast their expems
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will pay dividends
and in many cases we don't
but we all should
dan replies so often you won't even notice that
that wasn't the case for me
we all know what he's talking about it
no more charge before youe
and then something falls off the wall
i canherently wait
only one1 of the people who are actually farmers
soopk to farmers
so what can we do
here's is about folteers
they don't get their money out
tking my child
she worked in a bank
i believe in the story there had to be told
i have to report it
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
he was smiling and we said go
we've been working together since pusing for your kids really
which brought us to this
you don't do much shouting
it wasn't who i was
here s where i stand
they don't have meanings
' changed the way we caught
a no idea
the boardv
why don't they cutch them alonf
they don't trust along
and this that fas
we don't usse audio we don't usse veedeo
so what to do next
butould i need your help

she contacted anyone and everyone who is willing to buy my work

there's nothing underground about it
it's right there for you to find
we only sell you aircomp
which means take my camera
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
and he thinks i'm saying take my picture
things are going as well
why are was gippingosis
this is a really important chapen to make
i wnderstand this relationship
i went to the dean
you're doing incredibly important work
and so many of my early memories involved intricate day dreams where i've walked across borders
one year i came up with the bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the work
you made it work for me
we know why ks don't learn
there is no need to play the market
i look at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the global level in
i could ever fe down
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
it's always what it was and what it can beat
let us have a hong kong nearby
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
i wasn't very good at reading thingas
we're on the grid
thanks very much
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarre that have helped them
there won't be a single moment in the schedule
i don't paint
this is going to become really freaking and obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad guys
again it will not happen overnight
i mean everyone did
it needs to happen
is it heavy
we let other people worry about it
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
where would it g
you can experience their sense of place
who would i meet
did i go there
the whole internet
i was looking for this thing that only fool seemed to look for
you can walk around them
all collective
and what is an idea roy
and it's completely okllo and what's the jokees
here i one person tauking to you
we just need to keep going
we don't eeden mores lot to continue
i think we need something like a mathattan project on the topic colitician toll
and we have problems that we desperately need to solve
three billion people todays the cellphonees can't tact the internet
don't create solutions to impress customers
so what did they do
why is it important now
and not just that
they met together
he was talking about the importance of coaching voices to men and changing the culture for locka oom and giving
and let me just put this in context
and you know what else you get
and that's what we did
we met men where they were at and we built a program
why do i believe them
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of ourth box
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible

you were born to
of those seven haveicar weapons
but it's a global phenomenon
just think about it
it's very hard to get up fords
we're going to stay with them forever
and that interface is beautiful
and does it matter
i was sugl with the interaction designed
designers aspire to be really great designers
and that's really what i find so intcrigusing about the reactions that we've had to be
you know it's like once again there is the whooole problem of design being ofteness and theool for art
but we want what we aspire to cae
i don't understand it
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
go i said again swep forming on my brown
for africans homegrown science fiction can be a world to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
it is in the water
it was faulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
it's a markter of empathy
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language was used by real people have them
textings has developed one from this slash
that's what text thing is
and so how does your brain give you that detail
i know i have
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
it' using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meanings
i'm toually serious
not what is it
they are the basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like commness and

they have divergent values
through our nional cmeras
the economy needs that
i wanted to understand who takes the job
full cleans are after us
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project with that
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
and this leads to audience
but this is the source of innovation
if we're still hungry we might have some more
we're not plinding with each other
there's a lader what we used to eat piza
