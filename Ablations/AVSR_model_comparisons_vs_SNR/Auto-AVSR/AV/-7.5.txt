WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE'D LOVE TO HELP
IT WILL BE VERY GOOD
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WHICH SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT HE DID
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY PERIOD
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
HE SAID WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
WANT TO WORK FOR HIM TO
BLOCKS HAVE NAMES
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK AT THAT
DO THAT MATTER
I DON'T HAVE A NO REVIEW
MORE TRUST IS NOT INTELLIGENT ABLE ITSELF
JUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
THE LENGTH OF THESE GUYS
NOT TO BE STRIPPED UP HERE
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL
IT'S NOT A COUNTRY
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE ABOUT
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
THE ADULTS ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS IN THE GALAXY
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED AT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WORKS
ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK A SECOND IN 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT THEY PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE THESE FACING FAMILY CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS TO KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANT
ACTUALLY STUDY HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE THOUGHTS SO I CAN NOW THEY FIND
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEY CAN GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S NOT A QUOTE TODAY
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IS HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WHEN THERE'S THIS SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY
THE PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY A TON OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IT'S RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD READ THE TROUBLE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M WITH ME
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE BASIC GUYS
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCES
AND THEN AT 11 O'CLOCK THEY STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH A BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WOULD
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUTRAGE PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS

THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP THE CAR
ABOUT A MILITARY BRAT
THEY DECIDED BECAUSE THEY WANT SOME FORM OF REVENGE
ONE WOULD BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER ONE TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
IT'S FUN COOL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WON THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LAUGH
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
IT MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WE DON'T USE AUTO WE DON'T USE FAILURE
HOW ARE YOU
THE BOYS ARE WRITING ME OF HOME
I DON'T WANT TO
MY SON IN ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE THE DAYS WERE NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO GO HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GET TO DO THAT
THEY CAN GET THE JACKPOT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISS PRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND IT
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK OR
WHAT ABOUT
LET'S HAVE THAT
WE'VE NEVER SAID THAT BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST ABOUT
IT HAS TO STOP IT
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND NOW WE HAVE A SURFACE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU REPEAT DOING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MATERIAL
AND THE GREAT THINGS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTED TISSUE
ORIGINALLY EXAMPLE WAS AGED 1894
HOW SAD ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE IF YOU GIVE YOU MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
THEY'RE DIFFERENT NOISE
NOW IN ALL PERIODS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU'VE GOT TOO MUCH EDITING
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE RARE GAP CHANGES REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF AT LEAST
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT IS
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING WRONG
IT'S GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE
HE RECONCILIABLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT A COUNTRY
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S REAL JOB DONE TO BE HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE HERE THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
DID THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE TARGET THAN YOU
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL CASES
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WHILE THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
SHE WOULD HIDE CLOSET
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISERS ARE EXCITED
HIS NAME IS LANI HE'S THE VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALFTIME
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA I TALK ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
WILL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING ON THE FLOOR AND YOU SEE A PILL
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WORLD
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
ONE OF THEM GOT CALLED UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THAN
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE
WHEN I WAS TEN I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BACK DOORS
HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS OPTION
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DATA APPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALK
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGE BEFORE YOU
LET'S BUY
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S MOBILE MANIPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN TO A WORKFORCE
I TAGGED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WOULD KEEP ME ONE OF THEM
YOU WROTE THAT
I'LL BE TOO FAR
THAT HE CAN REALLY KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD TO DO THINGS SOMETIMES
AND POOR THEY WERE LIKE
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW TOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
SO MUCH BECOMING THE SYNTACS OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S THE SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD DO
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND SUPPORT CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
DID YOU GET YOUR AUTOMATIC
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND THIS IS REALLY CRUCIAL
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS A FAILED RECIPE
AND I REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 37 SCENARIOS ROUGHLY 600
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF US
I'M 27 YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT TO STAND THE RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WILL GO WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY ARE WE COMING OVER THIS
I WENT TO THE DAY
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO RIDE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT'S THE PROJECT
WE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WENT TO CHURCHES OFTEN AS I COULD
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VALUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE MAGIC
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 MALS
MY WEBSITE
SO IS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE ARE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RATE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE THOUGHT IT
NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAVE COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE EYE
WHAT IS IT LIKE TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
HE'S A BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THIS BODY
WELL YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USE AT FIRST IN MEDICATIONS WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY HAD AN OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
SO WHAT IS AN IDEAL DOG
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
THERE ARE COLLECTIVE
AND IF YOU COMPLETELY OKAY WHAT YOU DON'T
THEY CHANGE FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
AND DEGREES BELOW ZERO
THEIR LOVE AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE THAT THE DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
TO EMERGE
THAT'S ALL FOR THAT
SO
THANKS FOR ASKING
I SAID WHERE IS HE NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGED THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPECT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO POWER OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOYED FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMAN'S FEMINISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADS AROUND A BRILLIANT GIRL WHO ARE A LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO
I LEARNED TO WAIT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WAIT AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST
WE SEE THE BABY'S BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES
IT'S THE OPERATOR
I LOVE WHEN
I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
IT'S GOOD TO START THAT
I MADE MORE MONEY
THIS IS GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLATE OUR WORLD BANK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE
THEY WANT THAT DREAM
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
WHY NOT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REASON HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THREE
AGAINST ONE SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN AS A CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TELL IT OFF
KNOWING
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
DON'T MEAN WRONG IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE COMMON ENEMIES
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WELL
AND IN THAT
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO THE WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING THE ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WHERE ON THE GRID
YOU ALL WALK INSPIRES YOU WHY
I ADJUST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES

IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
THESE ARE ONLY PARTICIPATORY BACKED UP
THE GERMANY AND FRIENDS
FOUR TIMES THE MASSIVE
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO COUPLE THE TAILS
I WOULD CERTIFY IT
WHAT YOU WERE DYING FOR
THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
WHAT IS THAT
CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WAS READY TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
BECAUSE THE WAY WE TALK
TO PROVE THAT

THEY DON'T TRUST THE LAW

INTELLECTUAL
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
R IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT EFFICIENT
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST
HOW OFTEN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY DAD
MY DAD IS OUR TERRIBLE DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED TO MOVE
I'M TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
EVEN WHEN IT'S SO HARD
I NEED NOW TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
IS IT THAT I LIKE TO EXPLAIN
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENT DEMANDING CHANGE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST CRUSHING POVERTY WIDENING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IN DEFINED APARTMENTS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN THE ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE'VE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRADE OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THERE
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CRYPTOCITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I HAD BABIES
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RATE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS DAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I DON'T LIKE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WILL THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE AND NUTRITION
DIGITAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
THAT'S EXCITING
GIVE US MORE THREATS
THIS HAPPENED EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USES WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM NATURE
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE GET
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT DATA
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE IS AN ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT ONLINE
DID NOT EAT INVADED THE NETHERLANDS
WITHOUT A REAL LIFE IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY PEOPLE
IT WAS LIKE A STARK YOU KNOW
I STARTED OVER UGANDA
OR NOT THE BEST
I'M IN TUCSON
WE HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOK FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SAY AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROW
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITING
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICAN HOMEGR AND SCIENCE FICTION IN THE WORLD POWER
IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN A STOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK I GOT 238 AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
IN FACT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MIGHT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW LOCAL PLACES
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE END
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ MYSELF HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT HUMAN
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU
WHO'S GOT THE EVENT
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
HERE IS A POLL
PAINING THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FILES OF MY LOVE
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVE FOR ME
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WE REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE SEE THE YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW YOU BUILD THIS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP SURE
BEING USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMS UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LANDED ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
AND WE LIKE THE ANSWER

SUPREME COURT WAY DOWN FROM WHAT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW HE HAS TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME IT MEANS YOUR FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GOOD OLD FASHIONED WAY
FIRST THEY FOUNDED POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEE EYE TO EYE
HOW FAR ARE WE RECEIVED THIS TRAIN
NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
BETTER DRILLS IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
SO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WAS JUST GIVING INSPIRATION THAT'S MY JOB
THROUGH OUR NORTH SHORE CAMPUS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY ON BACK FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROUSEL
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS
IT'S ABOUT YOUR GOAL
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DIVERSION VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOU AND IT'S A NEW OUR TV CHANNEL
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BOOMSTONE EITHER
THERE CAN ANIMATE THE SERIES IN THE WORK
LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING IN WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF A MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET JOE WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OUR FEET
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHER SAID NO THIS IS RIDICULOUS
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB ONE
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORST
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OPERA ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT WILL MOVE YOU
I'M IN THE CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WOULD HER FIGHT
SHE DIED AND SUPPORT NETWORK
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHT
SHE WAS DOING OK
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGE IN CLIMATE
INDEED WE WANT THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUGGLING
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DO THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED TO CONTRIBUTE IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA
IT'S INCOMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER A FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S THE WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S ENLIGHTENMENT
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED BACK TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WHICH BROUGHT US TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TEST DELIVERY
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THEY HAVE AGE
THEY HAVE COMMON CORE
TO MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT COULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SO WE NEED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
TO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT GETTING FIRED THEY COULD HAVE TRADITIONALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT
WE HAVE TO HIT YOU THAT
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF GOT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOMES
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN IT HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE AT A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES OF FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO WORK
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO OVER AS WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THE SOUND STUFF IS MADE MEMORABLE
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL UNUSABLE
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
WE MOURN WOMEN COMPLICATED
I WAS CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
STUDYING HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN LOSES HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN DO THEIR FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH SUPPORTERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE
FACE WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE TURNED BYRON
LET'S DO BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I WOULD RUN AND DRAW
THEY WERE TAKING IT FOREVER
OF THOSE SEVEN HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
I'M PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY IS THE CAUSE OBVIOUSLY RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
LOOK FOR THEM
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TESTING IS
HE'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE THAT'S USED BY REAL PEOPLE ASK THEM
TESTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE
WE CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO THINK CRITICALLY
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WE HAVE TO GET QUIET
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DECISING LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT I DIDN'T AGREE AND THE WALL STREET
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
HE KEPT ONE IN THE LOVE DEPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DID SHE STAY
SHOW ABUSE DELAY OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE PICTURE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT IN YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND
ARE THEY ATTRACTIVE
I THINK A POTENTIAL MATE
I WANT TO STICK TO MY MUSICAL
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL IN 10000 PHASES
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLAYING IT SO HARD FOR HOW DO WE GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TOO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
TO YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE NEED
WE ARE TERRORISM
THE TIME MAJORITY DID NOT NEED TO BE TIRED
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE ALL KNOW THIS
OK THAT WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE GUY YOUR COUNTER
WE DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTER MAKES NO FISH
AS AN INVENTOR I TRY AND TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHERE YOU GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN UNDOMETRIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL

FIVE PERCENT A DAY
HOLD THAT WATER
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECTIVE HAND CAMPAIGN
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTRODUCTION IN PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
SHOULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE HOLY TREND
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOLS SEEM TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
BUT LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD GET THE BEE
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
NONE OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY INNOVATIVE
AND THEY SAID WELL I JUST CARED SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FROM THEM
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY THEY'RE POLITE
WHEREAS TV TAKING MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES
WE ARE ATTENDING TOWARD OTHERS
THE TAB SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SEX AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO SEE
I WAS TALKING TO THE INTERACTION SIDE
IT DOESN'T MATTER
NOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THIS WHOLE PROBLEM
TONIGHT IS INSPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT TONIGHT
BUT WE WANT WHAT WE INSPIRED
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES
NOW AT THAT TIME CAME TO NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST INTERESTED IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CABINET POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A YELLOW STICKY AND THEY WOULD WRITE SOME DATA AND PUT IT UP ON THE BOARD
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A RABBIT TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OAK AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
WE TOOK CAMPING OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE PUBLIC SAVINGS TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVINCED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DIET COURT
AND 67 OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ART AND FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FELT THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IT IMPACTS DENSITY
IT ABOUT CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL STAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION OUT
AND AT THE UP OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY LIKE THE BASEBALLS NOW 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST THEY ARE
OUT DINNER WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER TO CALL IT
HE WANTED TO GET HIS HAND
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
I DON'T LOOK DIFFERENT
I'M LIKE GEORGE
AGAIN THAT'S JUST PLAYING
I NEEDED EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY INTERVIEW
I WOULD TRY TO DO ONE DAY
AND I GET MY UPGRADE
WE MUST ADAPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE TOOLS HE IS SEVERELY REPRIMANDING
EFFECTIVELY THE TALIBAN CREATE A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE TAKES OTHERWISE
NINE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
AND YOU WALK AROUND AND POINT TO THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WATCHING THEIR HANDS
DO YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HAND AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN WHAT YOUR HANDS CAN DO
BUT I LOVE IT FOR IT
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
WE CAN MAKE PEOPLE
DON'T CREATE TOOLS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE ALL BE BIASED
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT THERE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
ARTIFICIAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BIGGEST GLOBAL PHENOMENA
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO STUDY COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION WE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENT MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT AND SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOESN'T IT LIKE
OR A FIGHTER FLYING
AND IT'S POWERFUL
I LOVE HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COMFORT
OTHERS PRESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAY RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN IT EVER
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
THEY'RE DOING AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE HERE IN A STONE AGE VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WILL BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITY COMBINED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO WRITE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER AT MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING BUSINESS AND GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BALANCES
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN OR WOMAN
I WANT TO GO
AND I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID GIVES THEIR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
NOW I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WALL
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE GETTING JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
BUT WE'RE GOING ON OCCASION
AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY GRAIL MY ROUTINE STONE
AND NOW I LOVE LANGUAGE
I DO NOTHING
AND THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULD POSSIBLY HATE ANY MORE CARS
I HAD CAFFEINE
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
IT'S ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 OF AMERICANS
HOW ARE YOU INFORMED
WE PAY TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OF IT
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT TO BE TO REACH
SO WE DID THE ANALOGIES AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TABLE
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECONDUCTOR
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DIDN'T OPEN UP
I KNEW THIS THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS THE POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
WHY SHOULD IT
DID MY CHILD
I BELIEVE THE STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
YOU WORK IN A BAG
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
WHO CARES ABOUT BOSTON
WHICH ENTIRELY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT
I DON'T BE GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY UP
MAKE IT GO AWAY
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
YOU MIGHT GET A PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREEDING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WOULD MOTHER TO IT
THAT IS SOME DEEP EMOTION WHETHER WE WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I'M HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOBILE TRAIL
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
IT'S ABOUT QUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING LIKE THE BREED CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND DRILLED A SEVEN DRY WELL WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THE PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING OIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE A PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW DEEP INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE NOTICED WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CAR AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WOULD JEALOUS
NO IDEA
THAT I'M A NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WHAT ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE GOING TO GET SCARED TO THE HELP
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PATIENT
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
YOU NEED TO AGREE
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
COMING UP
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A LOSS
HOW CAN WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND POOL AND BOAT AND BREATH
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE PASSION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
CHEMICAL MAILS
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SPEND MONEY
WE WOULDN'T TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR SALE SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY DID YOU BRING THIS UP
HAVE YOU LAUNCHED THE MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAS
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I SAID JAM
AS I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOUR WIFE LEFT IT
I MADE A MISTAKE
HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO
I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS IN MEDIA SCHOOLS
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR ON AMAZON
THIS IS NOT TESTED
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND EDITING AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL GRASPING DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITION
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAY THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF JOY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GET TO WORK
WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DO WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES HE GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LEFT
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FIRST TIP OF WATER
AND THIS IS THE ODDITIES
BUT THIS IS A SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WHAT IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
WHAT
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WHAT DIFFERENCES MAKE
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT HELPING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET
WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THIS IS NOT A PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO ON POOR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW CAN I LET THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS DAMAGED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH AT STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE USING RITUAL
THIS WAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
ARE SCANNED INSIDE OUT
AND WE LISTENED TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WASN'T
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BASIC INTEREST
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
SPIRITUAL
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WHY NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMEN'S HEARING COMING UP
LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT LONG FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
TAKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAIL TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WOULD ALWAYS DREAM BY HOW PEOPLE CAN
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BAKER MODEL
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND WORK LIKE A DOG
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S HOPE
THEY WERE ALL WHITE
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
I DID REWARD THE
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTAND THE HUMAN CAPACITY CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID TECHNOLOGY COMES FROM FLORIDA
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST OF THE KIND OF MEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX THEIR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKAGES
BUT THIS WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TWO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST WRONG IN AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORLD
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM AT THE ENDING EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST A VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENT AND NONPROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARGUMENTS THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY KIDS WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDENDS
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MASTER
I KNOW WHAT IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARROW FRUIT
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SECOND GRADE CROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE ARE THE MILLIONS OF WAYS TO EAT PIZZA
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
IT'S A BIT OF A DIFFICULTY THAT YOU PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IT'S MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING STORY THEN AT THE RECEPTOR
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE THAT
COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLOP ORGANIZATION
THEY DO POLLS RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLLS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP SHELLS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN
THE WORDS DON'T ROADMAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE 1
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I GO
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE A TRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I WAS LIKE WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PREDICT WORDS BECAUSE THE WASHINGTON TRAILER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROBABLE TIP
YOU CAN HAVE A SPACE
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST THAT BUSINESSES COMPLETE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND DECORATING TIME TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LONG VIRTUAL PARTNERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING ORIGIN
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT MADE
THEY FEEL A GLOBE
