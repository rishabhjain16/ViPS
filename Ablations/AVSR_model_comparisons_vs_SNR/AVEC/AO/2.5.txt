they want to be part of it
and they say i was working for a poverty but what will it mean about my career
i don't know
i' is opect
and we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
why is that
the what differences they make they talk like doriy findell
ll what differentcutions make
now i will maintain it
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is gird
the boys reminded me of home
it wasn't like them to this practice
1cent for getet to do that
i don' want to
i said in arabic
after college i desperately needed kind of place to call home
theyaen hit the jack part
look at the end it's the animet
i'm in apacible right now
what is the abstract che
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an off they all night lon
that's what needs you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the world
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
the kind of the anti reality can seed
and it's hard and it kids courageh that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famouess
how are we going to do that
so naturally asked what is after
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy a global mowwar campaign
it should be inspiring
how do you know for sure
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply phitical lis
he and remember he had experienceed with this
in other words a corner to find theach things as this to fato
what can we did all that
roughly 300 savings and lons ofvol roughly 600 deeeter
what do youed do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that' allowed me to take a stand on myself
patriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i m the survivor of all forms and sexualmused including food
and guess what silicon valley
i tried engaging people
and they also knew that they could happen to work for
don't know
but people did not relate to it
people triy to the doing ideas
and that s actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
which was no structure
out toginn with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
you do train them however to adjust passion according to where they are
he wanted to sit what he could stand the room wh he could plan escate routt he could get his hands
and that's exactly what that is
you're go to call of
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always trying to ma it faster
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings thempts of phistion
there is no more of it
so we did the analysis beg in alightly different way
we take two to three times more than anybody else
l' go back and visit our equation
sustainability has got to be a pree comompetitiveation
even if we get everybody working on its got to be sucuted
so was mother choica
we that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have it over
let me give it a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it' is given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve class
you lon't at the same witnesses of their positions
again in a car
thousands of women started teaching out me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shames
i was petrified
not a lot of hands
and when she went complain to a major she said what
spucial realiasment doesn't discriminate
they just do it
they all look the same with them i need to firstcoc me
i think about it all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it is not possible
and ganas has progressed
and it's happened every day
they are looking and looking and finding l
wh you
i think this is a problem
that as jo in boston
it's more halpy cases
you can't hide behind anything other than your own pea
i why did i really have to fve ong
and it's not that they didn't want me to critically
you can't run around in the darkn
what can i do about it
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about its
you'll never want tog
so let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mil to be thrown away
and you're bro in your back
the keia really a knowowledge
these guys could be true to their personse which is finding more than gus
we need to be part of the community to survive
isn't about a quality
we all know be inside of the answer is
we've notsoce a babies
i started looking at them really carefully
is about systems
i looked at my friend with brilled seven dry weals writing upf more than a billion dollars to
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decisions
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with comremendous courage
so we locked ourselves ino the room for two days and we tried to figure out what found us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what it's foro value for us
profeionally when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also trained our brain to cheune out in somebody else's issues
this meants that the movements de maanding will change knew what they were basced frushing poverty wide
well very often you think about political change and defined compartners we
so i want to talk to you today about when i think is a much more concree recipe for deep
a couple of years ago a group of in canada decided that we were hitting the limit of what we could accomplished
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just far of the same species
we repired the same family
i have three thoughts to actually how they fight
and i won't make names but you know who you are
you see as a disruption of real lifetime important work
we c camers
when it's 10 degrees fow hero
you destroy all the brone marrath and cancer pation with massive joices of chemotherapy
and she suffered so much
its love and their friendship and their protection
could emerged
the question why does she stay
which is why that i believve thely in the wece job and the great shiny future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love of psychological trust disguised as love one
he kept one in the glob department of our cars
and here's where those gunsmen
and it just graduated from harbard college
showed use to light a day by talking about it with your children your cow workers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to speak
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
and when we are unprepared we overreacted
they're not my children
and i did not know what to saf
we can bun healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate location
on the other hand statistics hs a subject that you could and should use
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11'clock he stopped talking about these del issues
you can try it
everything the universe we about
and that blew my mind
howful is that
that's nothing special
again he had no choice
it had no choice
i realized fr that all countries are used
just when next the last thing w
you don't get a chance to mess it up
one of them got crawled up in the water
my mother was on the line tell me that doctors have found a lump his stomach chiminal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just say home
so we decided to go to the mom
i feel that god' know
he wrote back
as i talked along with my neighbours
on mal d
and i said to myself i want to get more of them
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
bolly it m of a larm
it's what we need
you can great guye
so i'm not saying that thingain in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
the job need to be challenging
the science is there
they did drive better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated track extracking technologies to the re existing company that i work for
we're not there yet
and see there's a lot of thing you just don't have data
with that you can actually trigger aght fundies the four rises can happen
it's the win all around
the comming of age to bring you data ino humanitaran the world
and that's the vig deal for a profession that's in high demand
some geremy and friends
surely we know enough
at four times the message for sun
you have to get quiet
you haven't dearned it
i te you
there's a flip side as well
it's shocking to realize that only 28 of american
i will not forget theday we got that text message
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not to tell anyone
i think it might be a lifeline
that last tim's the natural text message that we receive
it's my dad
and so is that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hot line
he've that the event
i can use it in my company
whatever it is about that priston where they were born things like that
you're reconiledble de difference' right
they supported me all the way through it
that's something we had to celebrate
she got better
wek last with people who listen to us
something was wrong
the notish inslated the metherlands
when i get out of this am i going to be rejectant
at some point i'm going to get out of
we really don't walk anymore
he'd love to help him
locks havepp neins
we have no susbect
you took cndon off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
i ran a campain police department he pook in fact
and all of this matters greatly because pblicating to is the most important conunction of
but when you start to look at the data ish by the way the judges don't have and we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on youw and data and analytic to help make the most critical decisions
and at the op other end of this couction were doing a equ terrible job
the impacts ledu se
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drugation on the treets just around the corner from our office
it impacts crime and violence
some people call it dad a science
and one of them said they had a rivi two week ago
and they would take a yeow stict me and would writ something on it and they would put it up on a b
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and i couldn't get this information
they were unbelievably expective to administer they were high kitching them they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exactame way that i did about the state of
so when i started my dad at the arno foundation i came back to look at a lot of these proquestions and i came back
we have no subffects
now at that time hendoni jersey was the most dangers city in america
and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
you look the baseball st have 20 years ago
it impacts everythay
it worked for the opening and it worked for these fame of conperm
they're just waiting for their d it for
than i didn't expect that because i expected one of theose
and theent to celeears of
and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love countryut which is really
this is not a photal profile for your facebook
how about you
i was going through a hard time of woray
i was like what
it was the only part that batery backed up
woman' days coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to anim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results of often surprise
i don't care
wealth it's ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproeducted
they don't represent what our views are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamel
this economy won't work and thomas jeffersons saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
but you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at copking their natural environments to get them to privee
what makes the heart unique
i want to be the center of potention
why is it not working
psicul un ful to naturally be able to do
did you share he are gone mind
thank you very much
why not just thatet businesses compete
and then i thought it got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
what it card
let's not a firstay
they fel that what they need when they need it
to six people
because the water stay there forever
we findally olicate
and then guf one
and after that initial prototype was set out to make crean opens for software so that others do not have
so why don't we leverage that
to be leverage the cloud
on that the pas
needffordable health benefits
how should we work
it is about earning as much as the possitble can
how should we live
we need to reinvent labor organization
i would never want to do that
take a look at these
and you don't know that it's a homeless sheltter
you don't have to bring any fores because the washer and der are flee
sort of leadership of humiliation
and said where is now
fakes crashing
and they are not just focused on money
it's a performance venu
we imagined
but it's not enough
i built a career
thank you very much
you feel much
weird hoor
but when i was little out of remember he would kill lives in our house with my vvguns
so to summize if we could offer a cogh quality education to everyone around the world for free

thank you very much
it's really teaching them how to light a light
but here's the thing
i don't know
and that's bad
it was a poem
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
my parents came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid ofppreciation and they wouldn't even watch in menope
so what was i going to do
that is theright answ

i attractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
rman and 60 years to day
so i changed my immediate go to become up the paes
what makes technology useful and usable
we have to turn that around
and that led me to this project
i became a psychology teacher and i devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
the when the church is often as that could
how do they operate
why are we invedded social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
it's how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
so we have these kees and famon cycles
so what do you think happens to these edoubts
we once again women get the ingroagrams and nobody can tell that they have a problem
and in fest it probably won
we've done the research
they're often not recognized thats homem
women are worth it
mortality is not going down just going up
who had to impersonate a man

it's about comomeing you placement therapy
and not enough this being done about g
i'm not sure what it was
and we w like to think it's not going to take 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have the manufacturing economy which is about building goods and products and now we have a surface
he would be issuing ordersd from a vva

how you chained behaviour
even that with it
some good not everybody
she wanted to chrean quality at the government level
for the deep these cows
it's not a luxury
it's not octical
we're not going shipt that peet
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to youears
but it's not just china
where the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things set and i want to share three of them that we pick up in our own work
he had drawn of liane and it wasn't just iraq in afghanistan
i do believe we can fix what's broken
you know watching
he got fart time i
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history as the one that we have
how do you find that dinosaur
that this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological records
so we need a system that helps all our teachers to be as good as the bald
i'm talking about two truth
how would i know what i was doing to different
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was only w you get anything done
efficiency is foror of rbotce
human relationship or not efficient
that's the bilible right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control of rew forources
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now you have over
she never had to dck and cover under her desk at school
but it's also an important date for another reasons
but before that cooperationould be realize enedy is assassinated and that further
maybe i didn't experment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket time
p pick up the keys
i actually have no idea why
i didn talk to them
i am pushing and fulling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military cateadory
that's the work that stands before us
it's an uncrscious process
it's an automatic process
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
were the fact is more like 5 percent
the we finally figured out how to do it
they don't have an inform
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other forirst flip of water

how much hechs
so when we met chalcy to senior in high school
the question for us now is how much can we make a this
that a single one
i will be back
it's the war of hemic
but i love it for it told me get free
they make sense of the past
but it wasn't just in the bit more
what a contradiction
but it's different
it' is not a put down of anyone
it is irresponsible
it is won
are we prave enough to welcome it
start to walk in the community and to be take a rocket scientce which to realize that they weren't
they need support

i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
why aren't we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
he also had 11 children
not the wife not the kids
he should not have been surprised
please look at me

and i would go inrou offision
and this routine went onf for some time
and now i love it
most of my fries are taking japanese
i was always very small
and kn nothing
so water it is something that scared me at the beginning
this i thought why not punish myself
and this became my holy gream i was at a stand

i'm a two sons
why would it made
it's a fucking aude
they feel at her in
how is it made
make it about because of purni
why don't you discover this anymore
what is the exact relationships between levels of greenhouse gases and panetary
don't we already know the consequences of the changing climate and our settled civilizations
imagine juggling a snowball across the confidnce
indeed we wonnd the risk of making things worse
we're seeing the baby brain
there were others like myself who we full times
he's a bad guy
the children the children was spot
it's not a biry word
but those surveyant features come at a cost
government officials are extremely mad
and i have to take a your arf
i exist because i have my liomen friends
and guess what
i know about you
they brow cracks
and so i think that nature is not thata which is unntouched by humanity mentalen
and this is great
i didn't disagree with it
i want to go
every shif there near nation
there's colon issue going on
there's people evverythen
but we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with wish we share
i was like oh the anaigon

's love her
you don't even need that a fancy amaed thingan
yet when she has to find seven hours because there is water all over per basceement she found
why is shown
so how is you that
you say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in a day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working way more than full time out
how often are we creaking my ideas
china is the world's greaterfan of poverty program over the last frew decoads
but two of our grandchildren probably will
it's natural connected tissue
can we really scale this up
then they have to bring them in
but you know what the actual facts are
but now what it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't we
without it we literally can't interface with others
my desire to disappear is still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find the way to globalize democracy or
for any national leader
he would lif the answer
they were arguing with one another about access to the ho resyts
the supreme forre is fall way down from what its used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing a new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have it
they would be invisible cpasity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first t10 people to have this surgery
fus we have stem soll
and when i was pen i didn't realize how meing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child todop aso
that was powriful
bake a haand
's actually not that hard
we want valuable data
now with a huge problem in be the earth place
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carys bell
and we couldn't just turn it off
who came from the way in which beijing has grown
you're in there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transp the climate transformation we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw id written down somewh
that's sort of the state of the art
and now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through
and so they kicked them in snd take place
i understand how this can happen
and in fact whatould happen to my brain
we now have a platfork
and my whole world did open n
and you there's that binecing
i'm a professor who passionate about education
we bought one of these
come on then
but there's actually more to the stories than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how the molecules are put together
effectively the tariban create a complete flatu of any other source of information
their farents are so forar they have no resources to get them dack
if any child is found violating he uss he is severely recommended
does anyth just matter
i'm not a military rack
one was to be assault with you
they sigided it because they wanted some commal benge
the other would be a baseball pl
but if they don't stay in cares the international pressure will be overwhelming
'srettyoo
we have the plan
i am thinking of your love and me
painlin through my body with the fires of my love begin
i am torn by a lghan
remember what i said my worf
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
we might say then well let's not worry about this
i mean at some point it's going to be your problems in
how does it happen
it was like a star t you
that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
can create a de centralized database that has the same efficiency of monopolies
we can see everything on theikipedia
it's a composit view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is that possible
so the berong looka if we don't have comedy inf
they have that idea
then she gets the bofes to reate how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get id of my job i just need to upgrade my broters
they know you can fail by starting a business because theyke or by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winer has come from a different fibal group
they have to be able to teach something as well
and in that i need a curcuce
and this wasn't just an astract myustterne
i couldn't care myself away from the coverad
african americans supported at a higher level than had ever been reppointed
and others presented this comparison between g rights civil rights and
we are looking for something more
i do like magic
will you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be c
we can't change our minds
they're completely flat and they're basically card voone characters
i got about 3000 emails
our website
so since then i've seame the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much ptentiion
about proving who you are and what you can do
brought the young ber men
and i went back home my mind said that yea i don't know who i am
and this is true
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
you board the plane
the engine fails
the plane take off
they dreamed of a variety of horrifying senario
there were no back doors
how do you get to build those relationships
you just had a new thing
so we created a newchool
and boy they were like what
but that is the mean that we can't
ow that's a very very diffpoint
we were wrong
we have to decide what it is
but this is why i heard from a lot of outage peoplee
the answer was no
thish is how stuff is made memorable
and i got pretty into it
back you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
now i know where i am here
but guess why
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of tm am i talking about here
for hepatitis it was also 2 and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated dreath activation
but imagine you're walking in the forest and youut a bent
and that's pretty amazing
but eventually they did come around
you are a healer in a stoningch village
and so it's pquick for something like that
we have to see beyond the surface
we're not heavily subsidized
they're not jonated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
there's no other ways
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience as it relates mentoring
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral talent that is in the tradition of other stes we have
this is a crisis that is getting worth day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is
you don't have enough money
and we all know it
ok then we could make a mobile bager1ar
you can get volunteers
drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple ment
imagine if we had across the country right now in multic places that
i have passion in my heart
it's just a los
hopes can bring the imagination to life and ways that wemind us that all of our bonds can be hes
i can stand up and do something
well's not yet
has a coherean movela
look at these predy structures
they their faces druadcast their skas
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will pay dividence
and in many cases you don't
but we all should
dam replies so often you won't even noticef
that wasn't case to me
we all know what he's talking about
no more charge beflore you
and then something falls off the wat
i can heart the way
only one1 of the people who are actually farmers
talk to farmers
so what can we do
he cares about false name
they don't get their money out
i with my chas
she worked in a bank
i believe the story there has to be told
i have to record it

why are we given others
this is a really important chapen to make
i understand this relationship
i wantent you to dean
you're doing incredibly important work
and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i wd walk across borders
one year i came up to the right idea
we can do this
and slf dn
i have looked at the best and i'm looked at some of the worse
you made it work for me
we know why it don't learn
is no need to play the market
i look at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the global level in
i could ever be that
sometends it's messy and it's always unpredictable

when we share ideas we all get more
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
i wasn't very good at reading place

thank you very much
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scared to the helping
they'll want a single moment in the schedule
i don't paint
it's going to become really friaking and obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad guys
again it will not happen overnight
i me everyone did
it needs to happen
is it heavy
we let other people worry about it
was the internationually in place that youke can vhysing
where would it got
you can experience their sense of place
who would i meet

's the whole internet
i was looking for this thing that only fool seemed to look forwd
you can walk around them
w collective
what is an idea joy
and justould doally ok what's the jot
here i one person costes you
we just need to keep going
we don't even more's lot to continue
i think we need something like a mathattan project on the topic of carffician so
and we have problems that we desperately need to solve
three billion people today with cell phes can't tact the incternet
don't see solutions to impress customis
so what did they do
why is it important
and not just that
they met together
he was ty about the importance of coaching voys and com ma and changing the culture of the locking room and giving
and let me just put this in context
you know what else you is
and that's what we did
we met man where they were at on we built a program
why do i believe this
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of our faxs
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still missing a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertisement council and we asked them to help us
this is your chance
which insaly is only a third correct
i don't mean giving up the internet

i was trgging with interaction design
designers asspire to be really great design as
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to these
you know it's like worce again there's the whod problem of design being often in the sputal art
what we want what we stired toe the pold
hion i don't understand
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
so i sed again swep forming on my drown
for africans homebown science fiction can be a world to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
i had no idea what i was going to do it gettningt worked

they were all fight
and look like a bowl
and not oh
i may never go to your house and may never come to my house
they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments and nonprofits have delivery armenties that are fully capable of covering this for
this is possible
even w it is so hard
that's what happened with my deesh
but it gets cand to loo
they get scared to walk around
maybe an as alzheimer's disease
we' try to find a better person
and what i need now is to learn to do like that
they won the game
and the problem wor'th allving is what are those
so bear with you
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i know fou ones i know forputers they've put me on the internet when i was young i
i did a world timare
what would that change that quality of life the nutritions
why didn't you just tell me that
what can i learn with you
can you find the god
so that was easy
and the way to do it is through the lifght stream
we weren't considered the real thing
so we need the solution and these people play the game they are trying out
so that's it for now
that's aful liright
and one after this actually got a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
it's just incredible
i was terrified
the same tool that united us to couple dictators

where eiving in taking a more of your innermomotive reer values
and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our traffic products
and we think about it that makes a lot of sense because farming of question is a really complex
let's think about your ethical footprint
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
he's had a technology conference in ward
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably won't
we have to fix the internet
most in the kind media would shut down
now theyon't get me wrong
