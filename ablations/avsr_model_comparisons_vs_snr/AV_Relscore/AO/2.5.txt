WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE'D LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
AND HE SAID I'M THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
AND HE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKEN BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIC OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATION TO TRY TO MAKE MEANINGS
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M FULLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
<unk>NS<unk> SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE COMMON AND AT
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM DYING
I FEEL GUILTY SOME FUN
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT SAYING IN THE WORKFORTH IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
WHO IT MATTERS A LOT
HE SAID WHAT YOU NEED
YOUR JOB IS SOME CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY YOU
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
BLOCKS HAPPENS
WELL YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK BACK
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE AN OVER <unk>LG<unk>
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN THIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE FROM US
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WERE THE HEAT THESE COWS
THEY'RE NOTHING SHIPPED OUT HERE
IT'S NOT FUNCTIONAL BUT
THE MODEL THAT THERE'S
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THEM <unk>LG<unk>
THEY'VE TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE GALAXY
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED AT HOME
AND THAT'S SURE WHAT IT WAS
AND ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE ANTIGRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE THESE FIST AND FEMININE CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBE AFTER THE TRANSPLANT
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE FREE THOUGHTS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUT HARD OF THE SAME SPECIES W
WE'RE HARD TO SAY EVENTS
AND I WON'T NAME NAMES BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DID THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME IN PUT
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUOTE WITH
THAT'S JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST IN THE BITCOIN
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROCESSY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATIONALISTICAL
IT'S THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON IS SAYING BUT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IT'S RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE FACE AT ALL FOOD
BUT YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILS
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE MESSY DIET
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCES
AND THEN AT 11 IT CLUCKILY STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
OUR MOST PROFESSORS WERE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THINGS
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF I WOULD SEE IT TO PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
THIS IS COMPLETELY DESIRE
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP CITY HALF
I'M NOT MILITARY BRAGGING
THEY SIGNED UP BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOMETHING BENG
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER TO
THE OTHER WOULD BE A FACEBALL THING
ARE YOU LIVING IN YOUR MIND
SO WHAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WERE CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
AND YOU FIND THE GOLD
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WORTH SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WON THE GAME
SO MERE WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
MAYBE WE FEEL SMART
YOU SAW HIM AGAIN
WE DON'T USE AUDIO WE DON'T USE RADIO
WHY ARE YOU
THE VOICE REMINDED ME OF HOME
I DIDN'T WANT TO
I SAID IN ARABIS
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT FORGET TO DO THAT
BATHING HIS THE JACK PART
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM MISPRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND THE
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU TAKE THEM AWAY BUSY IT COMES BACK HORRIBLE DISEASES
WHAT ABOUT FOLIO
LET'S COME BACK
WOMEN'S EVER STUDY OUT BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THE MAN
IT HAS TO STOP THE
PARTICIPATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SURFACE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE ISSURING ORDERS FROM A BUS
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY AND
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUES
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
HOW SAT ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE THE TRIVIAL MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
<unk>NS<unk> STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
SO WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH HERITAGE
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE CREATION'S RARE GAME CHANGE REQUIRES YOU TO FALL OFF AT LEAST
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IS THIS
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS TO BASTACLE
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL WAYS THROUGH IT I
SOMETHING WAS WRONG
WE'VE GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO CELEBRATE
YOU'RE RECKONED BY LITTLE DIFFERENTLY RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT ARE CONTRADICTIONS
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB SITAL BE HONEST
IT IS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
BUT THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE IS LAW TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
AND THE WAY WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC PART OF THE INTELLIGENCE
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO IF THEY WON'T GO FOR A LOT THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T FEED THEM
HE WAS HIDE AND PLAUSES
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN THE JOB GETS OUTSIDE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DOG IS GETTING
HIS NAME IS WANNIE LAS AND HE'S A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATIONS
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A BANK
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR OF EVERYONE
YOU DON'T GET CHANCED TO MESS IT OFF
ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
BUT WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS THAN
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF FIRST TEN PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS PENN I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BACKDOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
STAND REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE YOUTH
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATIONS
SO THAT'S MOBILE POPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE ONE QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN THROUGH A WORKFORCE
I TAGGED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
HE WROTE THAT
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
THAT HE HERE REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD A NEW THING FROM SOMETHING
AND BOOR THEY WERE LIKE WHAT'S
HOW YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
IT'S ALMOST BECOMING THE SAME TAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD YOUTH
THIS IS WHAT I'M FULL TO NATURALLY ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL FOR HEAPS
DID YOU HEAR HERE HAVE GONE MATH
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND IT'S JUST READING THINGS
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORONER TO FIND THESE THINGS WE CONSIST TO TAKE FATAL SEX SYSTEMS
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS AND ROOMS INVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 SINGULARITIES
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR EXPERIENCE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO FROM ALL OF THIS
<unk>NS<unk> I'M 37 YEARS OLD
AND THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE IT
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
IT ONCE THEN THE RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE DRAWING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO MAKE
WHY AREN'T WE SKIPPING OVER THIS
I WENT TO THE DEAM
BUT HERE'S THE THINGS
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
WE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
AND WHEN THE CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I COULD
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE IMAGINE
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLESH AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 EMAILS
AND MY OWN WEBSITE
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
THEN I MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RATE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW IT WRITTEN DOWN SOME WAY
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE LEVEL OF THE AGE WAVE COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WHAT'S THIS BRIGHT TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
AND HE'S THE BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE PLOT OF
WELL DO YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THEY GUESSED THAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGENS
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
AND WHAT IS THE IDEA GROWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
WE WERE ALL COLLECTIVE
AND IT'S THE MEDIO TELL YOU WHAT'S THE GOATS
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON FIRST
WE'VE WON'T DONE THIS
WHEN IT'S 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
IS LOVE AND THEIR STRENDSHIPS AND THEIR PROTECTIONS
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARRIAGE AND CANCER PATIENTS WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPIES
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
COULD WE MERGE
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATIONS
THANKS FOR ASKING AND
AND SAID WHERE IS YOU NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGED THE EPIDENOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THIS BAT
I'M A SEVENTH BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMEN'S FEMINISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADSTRONG BILLIANT GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKEN WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT VOICE CAN BE TO BREAK A GIRL
I LEARNED TO LIGHT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE FROM THE MOST NEEDS SUCH BRAVE IN THIS
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
IT'S 40 LOCAL TIMES
IT'S A TOP PREDATOR
AND I'M ONE GRAVEL
THAT I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I CONFECT THEM IN
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
I MADE MORE MICE
IT WAS GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANTS OR A WORLD BANK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORIES THAN BACK
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES WERE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCE THE OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
IT WANTS A TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL BONDING
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY AND SET
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
TRY NOT ASK ALL OF THE FACE TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING'S OFFERED
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE'S SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL INFLUENCE INCLUDING THROUGH
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN <unk>NS<unk>
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOU'RE IN THERE
BUT THE SECOND OF THE CHANCE OF THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
SO NOW IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE HOW MANY THE MELIEF
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH SOMETHING AS WELL
AND IN THAT I NEED A CERTAIN EXPERIENCE
MY RESEARCH CAME AND I WENT TO WESTPOINT MILITARY CATEGORIES
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
WHO OH WALK INSPIRED YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WIND FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOK AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL IN
IT WAS THE ONLY PART OF BETTERY BACKED UP
IN GERMANY AND FRIENDS
4 TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH WE
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO COUPLE DECADERS
I WOULD TERRIFY
WHAT IS WHAT DYING FOR
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
IT NEEDS TO BEHAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH US
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS WRITTING TO BUY MY WORK
AT SCIENCE EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
IT CHANGED THE WAY WE TAUGHT
THE BOARD OF THAT
HAS NO IDEA
THEY DON'T TRUST THE LAW
WHY DON'T THEY CLOSE THE LOSS
IT'S NOT TRUE <unk>LG<unk>
THAT WAS ONLY WAY TO GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S THE BILLBOARD RIGHT NOW
OUR IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT EFFICIENT
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES
HOW OFTEN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPEN WITH MY DAD
MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED TO MOVE
IT'S KIND OF BEFORE A BETTER PERS
YOU DON'T WANT IT SO HARD
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO DO LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
IS IT THE RISE RIGHT VERY WELL
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENT'S DEMANDING CHAIN KNEW WHAT THEY WERE IN DANCE FRESHING POVERTY WIDENING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS PURPOSES
WELL VERY OFTEN YOU THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE AND DEFINE TWO PARTS OF THESE THINGS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT IS POOR VALUE FOR
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMIT OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAIN TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUES
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONCE YOU SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
<unk>NS<unk> I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS TRUE WILL PROBLEMS
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW I SUCCEED
I HADN'T BAYED IN THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
THIS IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAVE STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS' PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS BUT NO COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG I
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE AND NUTRITIONS
A DIGITAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
AND THIS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
WE'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM A NATION
WHAT KIND OF RICH WAS ARE YES
SOME RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU DID
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT DATA
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF EARTH'S BOX
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING VOICES AND HUMAN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCK OF ROOM AND GIVING THEM
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RACE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ME ONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL EFFECT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVE
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT COTLINE
THE NAZIS INVADED THE NETHERLANDS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY VIEW GUNS
IT WAS LIKE A STAR PRECKON YOU KNOW
I'VE GOT TO OPEN YOU GONE TO
OH THAT'S THE FAST THING
I'M IN TUCSON
WE HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SET AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWN
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITINGS
<unk>LG<unk> IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICAN HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILL TO POWER
IT HAS BEEN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAVE FOUND A LUMP IN HISTOMACH PROMOTE CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 PIECES OF NASHED THE EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG HAND ABUSE PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM AND SOME SAFE PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE KIDS
IMAGINE IF WE HAD CROSSED THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW MOSTLY PLACES WITH
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS
IT'S JUST A WALK
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEARTS
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION FOR LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS CAN MEET MANY
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
INTERACTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON YOUR TABLE
SO IT'S OUT TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
<unk>NS<unk> I EVEN READ THAT YOU HELP HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT THE KNOWLEDGE
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS TO YOU AND
I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE THEM UP
WHO'S UP THE OPEN
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIMES
IT WAS A POLLING
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY BUS BEGINS
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVES AND ME
I AM TORNED BY YOUR LUSTANESE
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
SO YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IF THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING THROUGH TECHNOLOGIES AND
YOU LEARNED TO WORK ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP FOR
THERE ARE PEOPLE FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO READ IT RIGHT NOW
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKE OFF
THE ENGINE TRAILS
NO ONE ON LAND HAVE ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAS GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF QUARRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
IN THAT OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE THE SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THE ANSWER
FOR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
THE SUPREME COURT IS FALLING WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE HOLY SIZE
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAVE TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THESE OTHER PARTIES
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME ADVERTISEMENT I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW COME WITHIN WAS EVERYTHING NOT AS ME WAS NOT IN
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GOOD OLD BACK AWAY
FIRST THEY FOUND ITS POLITICAL PARTIES
THAT WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
THE KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY COULD BE
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY I WERE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE NOTHING BY THE EYE
HOW FAR AWAY WE FIND SLIMES
SOUL THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS THE PROBLEM
FETCHES REALS IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
DO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WOULD JUST KEEP THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THROUGH OUR NORTH STERNAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BACK FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROSELF
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WHAT AM I THINKIN
IT'S FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS THEY
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANCE
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BRINGSTONE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
IN SHE'S LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONES
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT WITH SCREEN LINKED TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT YOU RUN YOU DAMN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S THE COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING IS BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCKLES OF SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OUR LIVES
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE WE SHOULD
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST WESTERN CALLED ME AT FEMINISTS
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED IN MY HAND
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITOR THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS IT EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORDS
AND SO FAR
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A RIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OFFER ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVES YOU
I'M IN THE POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FIGHT
REGARD AT SUPPORT NETWORKS
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER BRIGHT AND
WE'RE DOING OF HIS
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SETTLE CIVILIZATIONS
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUDGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE PROMISE
AND NOT JUST THAT
BEEN MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT REMAKE YOU THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED FROM TO DO WITH IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ON
IT'S A COMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIGURE AID FUNDINGS BEFORE A CRISIS THING HAPPENS
THEY DID DRIVE BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIN ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMANDS
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED FACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY AND THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR IT
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FROM WILSON FOR YOUR KIDS REALLY
WITH BROUGHT US TO THIS
WHAT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT IS
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS IN A RACE SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THAT THEY HAVE AGE
WOULD THEY HAVE A COMMON COAL
YOU MAKE IT FLOW FUNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRED
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVELS
I ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
TO PICK AT THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY FUTTING OUT DAILY FIRE TO THINK IT HAS SPEECHFULLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
THIS ISN'T INFORMATION THE
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HIGH
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT HE MISSED ME
WE HAVE TO ANSWER THAT
BOYS WERE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF THEM GOT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEMS WITH
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
YOU HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN HE HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST ONE WALL <unk>LG<unk>
I IMAGINED THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE HUMODITIES ARE FRESHED WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO FOR
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVED COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO OVER THE WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A COP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INFLUENCE
THIS IS HOW STUFF WHICH IS MADE MEMORY
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND MUSICAL
I WOULD CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
WE MOURNED WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIFE AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH GENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN THIS IS HER HAIR
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO HER BABIES
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TWO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVE LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACE WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE CURVED SPIRAL
TWESTERN BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DROP
THAT THEY WILL SIT IN THEM FOREVER I
OF THOSE SEVEN HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS
I AM PUSHING IT FULLYING WITH THIS OBJECT
YOU'VE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE THEY'RE ALL
BUT THAT WAS A BIG END YOU
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TOP TO FARMERS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE ABUSED BY REAL PEOPLE HAVE THEM
TEXT THING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS FLASH
WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND WITH THE DARKNESS
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN FEET
IT IS NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO CRITICALLY
YOU HAVEN'T TURNED IT
WE HAVE TO GET QUIET
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAFFIC DISGUISED AS LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT I BELIEVE DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB IN THIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS CAN END
WE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOBAL COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOW OF USEFUL LIE OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
AND I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DAD YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT THEM YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT MOVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS WAS TRUE
I'VE BEEN TRACKED IN
I LIVE FOR ME
WHEN YOU'RE SIX MAYBE YOU SEE THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLDS ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOALS IN MOUNTAIN STATEMENTS
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO
THAT'S WHAT WE DID
IT'S YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
I'M NOT COOL BE DEAD
WE SHARE THE CHAOS OF WALL
ALL THIS YEAR TOES AND
THE SILENT MAJORITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENT
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A HOME <unk>LG<unk>
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OK THEN WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE GAGGERED COUNTER
YOU CAN DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED AND DISCOVERED SOMETHING
NO PLANTON MAKES NO FISH
AS AN INVENTOR I SCIENCE TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW PICTURES <unk>LG<unk>
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A ONLY SELF TO
5 DAYS
HOW IS THAT PART OF ME
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM HAVING AN EFFECTIVE ADVENTURE
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
SHOULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEAN
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HAVING
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOLS SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
WE COULD EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEE
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATES BAYDREAMS WHERE I'VE WALKED ACROSS BORDERS
THE EPIDEMIC QUESTION IS VERY DEFINITE IN
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAFTY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY IT'S NICE THEY'RE POLITE
WHEREAS GIVING AND TAKING OUR MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVE FOR YOUR VALUES
WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS FORWARD OTHERS
THEY'LL SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S PRETTY WHAT I FIND SO INCREASING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD THROUGH THESE
I ALSO STARTED AN INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S A FULL PROBLEM OBSIGNED BEING OFTEN IN THE FOOD FOR ART
DESIGN IS ASPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
WHAT WE WANT WHAT WE INSPIRED TO APPROACH
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET SUPPORTED
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
THAT MEANS THE FACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE AND TRANSIT
NOW AT THAT TIME CANVAS NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITIES IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CANVAS POLICE DEPARTMENT HE BECAUSE THE FACT
THEY WOULD TAKE A YELLOW SICKY AND WOULD WRITE SOMETHING ON IT THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON A BUSINESS
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUBJECTS
WE HAVE THOSE SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OPEN AIDS AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF INJURIES
WE TOOK CAMPSON OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE POLITICATING TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAYING FORTH
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARNOLD FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISIONS
IT IMPACTS EVERY SINGLE
IT IMPACTS SENTENCING
IT IMPACTS CRIMES AND VIOLENCE
<unk>NS<unk> AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL STAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE AND WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION FOR HELP
AND AT THE OFF OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING A QUICKLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY LIKED THE BASEBALL SCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPRESSIVE THROUGH ADMINISTERS THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST OPTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
I REMEMBER FAR LOVE
HE WANTED TO SIT WHERE HE COULD STAND THE ROOM WHERE HE COULD PLAN TO ESCAPE ROUTE WHERE HE COULD GET HIS HAND
HOW DO YOU NAME YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP ME
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICANS
I DON'T LOOK DIFFERENT I
I'M NOT SHORT
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY INTERVIEW
I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH THIS
DID I GET MY UPGRADE
WE MUST ASTOP THAT WAY YOU'RE GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T THINK PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY RECOMMENDED
EFFECTIVELY THE THARIBAN CREATES A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO FOOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE DOES OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS TO
AND WE WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS THE THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS THIS
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WATCHING THEM MOVIES
DID YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HANDS I CALL ME
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT SPEAKER
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PATH
THREE BILLION PEOPLE PLAY WITH CELL PHONES CAN'T ACT THE INTERNET
DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS SUSTAINABLE
YOU CALL IT THE BIAS
YOU KNOW WE ARE RIGHT THEY ARE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKING TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
PARTISTS YOUR GIRL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END OF THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BIT MOVIE
THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO STUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED THE GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER FUSS
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE CHANGE
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WHEN I WAS
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOESN'T TEAR ANY PITCH IN THAT LIFE
OR A FIRE OF MINE
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
SO ENOUGH HOW MUCH <unk>LG<unk>
IT'S MORE ANNOYED
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T CARE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERAGE
AND OTHERS PRESENTED THIS COMPARISON IT RIGHTS THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST THE ASTRAP QUESTIONS
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE YOU
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING IN THE END OF EARTH WEARS OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORKS
YOU ARE HEALER IN A STONING VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE WE
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY OFF
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST NEED AFRAID MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS TO GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE THAT IDEA
THAT'S THE NEXT YEAR IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DRESS <unk>LG<unk>
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORTH DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE REALLY DON'T
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
LIKE WE EVOLVE ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN OR WOMAN
I WANT TO GO
IT GOES LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE ARE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER FRIENDS
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
WE'VE JUST THEM HOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER FROM SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
AND I WOULD GO IN ON THE PATIENT
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME PROBLEMS
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY GROUP MY ROSETTA STEP
AND NOW I LOVE MY FRIENDS
AND NOTHING AND
AND THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY FOR
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULD POSSIBLY HANDLE ANY MORE CAUSE
I HADN'T HAVE FAITH
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PART
THIS IS ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN'T
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED CORTIBLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZE THINGS
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A QUIT BESIDE AS WELL
IT'S SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'D NO MORE OFTEN
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATIONS
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT TO BE STRATEGIC
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TASTE
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETITIVE BEAUTY
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
HOW IS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
BREAK YOUR HANDS
TAKE MYSELF
I BELIEVE A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEM MONEY OUT
SHE WORKED IN A BANK
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
HERE'S ABOUT FALSE NEWS
WHICH INTERNALLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT <unk>LG<unk>
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
THANKS GO AWAY
MAYBE GO AWAY
MAYBE IT GOES WHEN
YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THEM HURT
AM I GOING TO FEAST FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE BREATHING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER CHARACTER
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHEN YOU WANT TO DO IT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I'M HERE
AND I WAS EATING FAIRY
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING THE MOMENT THIS
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
EVEN ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND WHO DRILLED SEVENTH DRY WELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WITH THE FINDING OIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW THE INSIDE OF THE ANSWERS
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE POP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS OF LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS I
I KNOW I DIDN'T
I COULD THEN THE NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUNDS
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAYS MORE THAN FULL TIME COUNTRIES
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT AND TIME TO DO AND MAKE THEM THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARED TO THE HEALTH OF
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WHITE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
BUT RIGHT NOW W
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTIONS
YOU WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND FOOL AND FOLK AND BARBERS
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY AND IT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVIDENCE
GOVERNMENT MEN
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU CAN KNOW MUCH
WE WERE EMPOWERING THEM
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY KIND OF CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY TO THE SALE OF SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
IT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH NO
WHY IS YOU DOING THIS UP
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TESTAMENT
IT'S THE DEATH WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AN AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I STUDY SHAME I
I GET IF I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
THE WIFE QUESTIONS
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO PERFORM THE FEMALE NORMS
AND IN CERTAIN ENOUGH HARDEST WORKING
I WAS THE MEDIA OF THE STUDENTS
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR IN NAME WAS ON
THIS IS NO INSENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAMES
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR SHE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL HALASMENT SELF AND DISCRIMINATE
IT'S NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTION AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE GOING OFF
AND YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT UP
FACT IT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPENS WORTH SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
COULD BE LEVERAGED THE CLOUDS
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANINGS
THROUGH UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LEFT
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION WHEN
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN A
WHAT DIFFERENCES IT MAKES IT TALK ABOUT PURISHMENT FELT
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THIS MAKE I
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HEART NEAK
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
IT'S NOT A PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
AND IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE AND
ARE WE FRAVE ENOUGH TO WORK ON IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GROW UP FOUR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW COULD I WORK THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED THE GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH THAT STAMFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
THIS WAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
THEY HAD HER SCAN INSIDE OUT
AND WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEARTS
AFTER ALL I WASN'T BIT UNCONVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD FOR MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT FORD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS FIT INTERESTS
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST THEM FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT WE DO
WITH THE NECK MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
IT'S PRETTY COLD
WE HAVE THE PLANTS
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMAN'S DEAL OF COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAIL TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP HOW WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGED
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TOWN ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONCASION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
HONSTANCE BAKER MOTTON
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND MORE FLACK ADULTS
THAT'S YOUR BRAND THOUGHT
DON'T REALLY THINK THAT
AND THAT GOAL
THEY WERE ALL FIGHTED
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAMS
I'VE SAID WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGIST'S PICTURE AND I DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY THAT CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T LIKE
MY DESIRET TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN QUARRED
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST IN THE PENIMEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKCHAINS
BUT LINDA WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS EFFECTS
WE HAVE THE TOOL BUT WE LAUGH THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRONE A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THESE SETS AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORK
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
NOW WAS A HUGE PROBLEM IN THE HEATING EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMINGS THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL COULD
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS THIS
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MOM
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOFS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S A MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO EAT PEACE TO
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE TO MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS TO TRIBE
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETIES WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING HISTORIC THEN AT THE PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLUP ORGANIZATIONS
YOU KNOW THEY DO PULL RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLLS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP GELS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROAD NOW
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO TRY ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM MORE THEY ARE
I WAS GROWING THROUGH A HARD TIME OF WORK
I'LL SAY WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING MANY PORTERS BECAUSE THE WASHER ENVIRONMENT ARE FREE
LOOK AT THESE PRETTY STRUCTURES
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPULSE OF A BOOK <unk>LG<unk>
THEY CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBER
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST THAT DISTANCES COMPETE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S NOT FUCKY FORWARD YEARS
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT MADE
THEIR FEEL AT HOME
