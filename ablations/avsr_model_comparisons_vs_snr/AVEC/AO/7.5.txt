they want to be part of it
and they say i weant to work in global poverty but what would it mean about my career
i don't know
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
we why is that
what difference is it make it they talk about juroryn cell
well what difference does this make
now i will maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is good
the boys reminded me of homeem
it wasn't like them to misspractice
1 percent could get to do that
i didn't want to
i my said in arabic
after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
they had hit the jack hot
look at the end ofs the animal
i'm in the prucial right now
what is the abstraction
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an off for all night longs
that's what neves you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the world
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of the anti reality tod
and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so naturally i asked what is aricut
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy a global malwar campaign
it should be inspiring
how do you know for sure
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply critical l on
and remember we had experienceed with this
in other words a correner to find these things because this is a fatal effidce
what can we do in all of us
roughly 300 savings some loans involved roughly 600 seniorfes
what do we need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
hatriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm the survivor of all forms of sexual views including three
and guess what silicon valley
i tried to engaging people
and they also knew that they could tap into a workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people started from inst ofuting ideas
and that s actually what happened
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
out to dinner with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
we do train them however to adjust aaution according to where they are
he wanted to sit where he could scan the room while he could plan escate rouff he could get his hand
and that's exactly what that is
you remember call us
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always trying to make it faster
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to the tips
there is no more of it
so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
we paid two to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equation
sustainability has got to be a pre competitivevicion
even if we get everybody iss working on it we've got to be strateged
so was mother teresa
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have an overfooel
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it's given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve croass
you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
again in a car
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
i was petrified
not a lot of hands
and when she went to complain to a major he said what
speual relassment doesn'tiscriminate
they just do it
they all look the same whether a microscope i mean to a first approximation
well i think about this all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
and dance has progressed
and this is happening every day
they're looking and looking and finding love
how are you
i think this is a problem
fett' reels in bososton
but it's more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teith
like why did i really have to move along
it's not that they didn't want me to critically
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mil to be thrown away
and you've broken your back
the key here really a ofnowledge
these guys could be true to their purpose that was finding o than gas
we need to be part of the community to survive
isn't about a quality
we all know de inside what the answer is
we've been onn since we were babies
i started looking at them really carefully
is it about systems
i looked at my friend to drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decisions
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what found us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its poor values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue
this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening
well very often we think about political change in define compartments these things
so i want to talk to you today about when i think is a much more comclete recipe for deep
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limit of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just far of the same fecies
we're part of the same family
i have free thoughts and i see how they fight
and i won't name names but you know who you are
you see it as a disruption of real life and important work
we've all done this
when it's 10 degrees flllow zero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy
and she suffered so much
this love and theres friendship and there' is protection
could we merge
the question why does she stay
which is why that i believ degree in the wall street jobs in his breat shiny future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological traf disguised asis love one
he kept one in the glob compartment of our car
and here's where those guns comomeent
i had just graduated from harvard college
show abused the lie of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
and when we are unprepared we overreact
they are not my children
and i did not know what to say
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should use
so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11'clock they stopped talking about these litle issues
you can try it
everything in the universe wears out
and that blew my mind
how cool is that
that's nothing special
again it had no choice
it had no choice
i realize course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last thing you want
you don't get a chance to mess it up
one of them got caued up in the water
my mother was on the line tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just stay home
so we decided to go to the mom
i feel that god knows me
he wrote that
i tagged along with my neighbors
i'll meet you there
and i said to myself i want to get me one of them
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
poy it matters a lot
he said what you need
he is a great guy
so i'm not saying that saying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
your job needs to be challenging
the science is there
datid drives better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated fack attracking technology from the logistics company that i work for
but we're not there yet
you see there's a lot of things you just don't have data on
with that you can actually trigger aid funding befor a crisis can happen
it's a win all around
it's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world
and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand
some germany and friece
surely we know enough
four times the messsage for sun
we have to get quiet
you haven't earned it
how can we do it
there's a flip side as well
it's shocking to realize that only 28 of american
i will not forget the day we got that text message
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not to tell anyone
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one's an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hot line
who's up the again
i can use it in my company
whatever it is about that person where they were born things by that
youll reconciilable differences right
they supported me all the way through it
that's something we had to celebrate
ince it got better
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something is wrong
the nazish invaded the netherlands
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
we'd love to help
locks have names
we have no suspects
we took caadon off the top of the list as the most dangers city in america
i ran the campan police department because of that
and all of this matters greatly because polbic safety to me is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
and at the op other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
it impacts sentencing
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office to trein it
it impacts crime and violence
some people call it data science
and one of them said we had a robi two weeks ago
and they would take a yellow sticky and would wait something on it and they would put it up on a belore
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the arno foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
we have no subects
now at that time handpon new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
and when i talk to jud who around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
del like the baseball scaps 20 years ago
it impacts everything
it worked for the open aids and it worked in the state of ne jersey
they're just waiting for their daying for
f and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
and 27 years old
and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a photo profile for you facebook
what about you
i was growing through a hard time as worll
i was like wh
this is the only part that battery backed up
wman' dealers coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
when we do the results will often surprise
i don't care
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
they don't represent what our views are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
this economy won't work and thomas jeffersons saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
but you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at copying their nationural environment to get them to thrive
what makes the hard unique
i want to be the center of potential
why is it not working
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
did you hear he h gone madh
thank you very much
why not just let bistinusces compete
and then i thought thiss got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
yes it's hard
that's the status quo today
they can't get what they need when they need it
gas just six people
just the water stay there forever
fqui the opposite
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype we set out to make creean open source software so that others do not have
so why don't you leverage that
could we leverage the cloud
or that's the tast
we need cortable health benefits
how should we work
is about earning as much as we possibly can
how should we live
we need to reinvent labor organizing
i would never want to do that
take a look at these
and we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dyre are free
sort of leadership by humiliation
he said where is he now
thanks forra askim
and they are not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we areaging
but it's not enough
i'm built a career
thank you very much
do you smell much
we would have tolerateim
but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my beay guns
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
feding overill well
we can open up city hall
i love building robots
what about manipulation
so that's mobile manipulation
and he wanted one so raadly
we can't identify with that part
that didn't happen to me
it made a gowt
make it go away
make it go in
thank you very much
it's notow like teaching them how to ride a bike
but here's the thing
i don't know
and that's bad
it was a poemm
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
my parents came from germany
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of comcaiion and they wouldn't even walk in front of us
so what was i going to do
that is the right answer
constant dare mly
how old are you
are they fential madze
are the attractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
where you sicx made you can do that
so i changed my immediate goal to 1000 faces
what makes technology useful and usable
we have to turn that around
and that led me to this project
i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
i went the church as often as i could
how do they operate
why are we embedded social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
so we have these feast and fame cycles
so what do you think happens to these e gals
once again women get me angigramed and nobody can tell that they have a problem
and in fact you probably want
we've done the research
they are often not recognized at home
women are worth it
mortality is not going down it's going up
he had to impersonate a man
so thank you for your attention
it told us about hormone replacement therapy
and not enough is being done about this
i'm not sure what it was
and we like to think it's not going to take 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which is about building goods and products and now we have a service
you would be issuing orders from a above
but in fact they found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
this is a real mystery
he was also the first pesson to call me a feminist
my brothers a lot of interested as i am
he could come over and help me
how do you change your behavior
even that wasn'ten that
some good not everybody
she wanted to change policy at the government level
for're going to eath these cows
it's not a lunry
it's not o sa
they're not going to shift that peeter
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been to pleasure speaky to you
but it's not just china
where are the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own woray
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just iraq in afghanistan
i do believe we can fix what's broken
we all want to
he got part time i
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history as the one that we have
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was the only way to get anything done
efficiency is four robots
human relationships are not efficient
that's available right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control of these forses
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school
but it's also an important date for another reasons
but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
maybe i didn ant experiment on myself without even knowing it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket science
pick up the keys
i actually have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and pulling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military academy
that's the work that stands before us
it's an unconscious process
it's an automatic process
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
in fact it's more like 5 percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
they don't have anyer
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other for alip of water
they were unexpected pleasures
or where' sh hee left
how much can change
so when we met chuck was a senior in high school
the question for us now is how much can we make of it
not a single one
i will be back
it's the war on her
but i love it for a totally differez
they make sense of the patt
but it wasn't just in the bidwar
water contradiction
but it's different
it is not a put down of anyone
it is irresponsible
it is wrong
are we brave enough to welcome it
start to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
they need support
we had law enforcement ps
so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
it cracked open my world
his name is lonanne hawt and he is the veteran of vietnam
he was hide in the pzeth
they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
they want to know how often your dog gets outside
are you losing your mind
so let's watch what happens
i'm not a social problem di
so what happens next
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
he also had 11 children
not the wife not the kids
he should not have been surprised
please look at me
so no more messing gaz
that option is actually not on the table
so it's up to us
but i would go in on occasion
and this routine went on for some time
and now i love myers
most of my friends were takingen japanese
i was always very small
and nothing
so water was something that scared me at the beginning
so i thought why not punish myself
and this became my holy griil i wass at a stem
i tried everything
and i thought this would be great fun
i'm in to son
why was it made
it's a fucking audy
they feel at home
how is it made
make it about the other parties
why don't need to study this anymore
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our setbtled civilizations
imagine juggling a snowball across the tpic
indeed we run the risk of making things worse
we are seeing the baby brain
there were others like myself who were full times
and he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not a dirty word
but those surveillance features come at a cost
government officials are extremely mad
i have to take a year off
i exist because i have my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
they grow crops
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or and woman
and this is crazy
i just disagree with this
i want to go
every kid lives near nature
there's coonation going on
there's people everywhere
but we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
i was like oh the amazon
and i'm sure the figures of similar other things
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
the rituals were familiar
how could i come from a nation
what kind of rituals are they
one billion people
but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate it
i know it works
but i'm not happy
so i went to my dauer
is it that i write very well
you might geting peace for that
so let's start theren
i want to know how they impacted me
i want to know how i' intpact dma
lots of money
this is great
it's the top frededitor
but i'm going to be so healthy
40 local economs
i neede more money
we've seen an image of our blue planet a world banks
i love re win
we don't even need that much time to be amazing things
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
we why you sure
so how do we do that
you say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in a day
but you can write it
and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
how else can we create new ideas
china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
but some of our grandchildren probably will
it's natural connective tissue
can we really scale this up
then they have to bring them in
but you know what the actual bacts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't ght
without it we literally can't interface with others
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
for any national leader
he wouldn't like the answer
they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
the supreme pour has fallen way down from what it's used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have it
there will be invisible capacity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first ten people to have this surgery
plus we have stem cells
and when i was 10 i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child develop autism
that was powerful
raise your hands
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the hai earthplace
it is about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carffcelf
and we couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing has grown as the city
you're in there
we can see how to do that
that' s really important
but the second of the transmm the climate transformations we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw it written down to me
that's sort of the state of the art
and now we want to do a double double of the age wayve coming through
and so they took them to some sake place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what did happen to my brain
we now have a platform
and my whole world did open up
and he does that benefit
i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
we bought one of these
come on man
but there' is actually more to the story than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how the molecules are put together
effectively the thalibal created a complete blackup of any other source of information
their parents are so forar they have no resources to get them back
if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimmended
does any of this matter
i'm not a military rat
one was to be a soldier
they signed it because they wanted some form of benge
the other wasould be a baseball player
but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
prettyool
we have the plan
i am thinking of your love for me
painruns through my body with the fires of my love fgun
i am torn by your lovean me
remember what i said my life
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
we might say then well let's not worry about this
i mean at some point it's going to be your problem too
how does it happen
it was like a star trek cell
and that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of monopoly
we can see everything on wikipedia
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is that possible
so go me wrong it's like if don' have comedy the relief
they have that ideas
then she gets the bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better at my job i just upgrade my browsers
they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupts or by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winter has come from a different tribal group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need a survey acc
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i couldn't tearre myself away from the coverage
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been reported
and others reresented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
we are looking for something more
i do like magic
will you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be the case
we can change our minds
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
i got about 3000 emiles
for my own website
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much potential
it's about proving who you are and what you can do
brought and young w men
and i went back home and i said dadyea i don't know who i am
and this is true
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
he board the plane
the engine fails
the plane takes off
they dreamed of a variety of horrifying scenarios
there were no back doors
how do you get to build those relationships
you just had to do things sometimes
so we created a new school
and boy they were like what
but that is the mean that we can't
that's a very good point
we were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this is what i heard from a lot of outlege people
the answer was no
this can how stuff is made memorable
and i got pretty into it
ack you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
now i know why i am here
well guess what
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of tm am i talking about here
for hepatitis it was also 2 h5f times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a band
and that's pretty amazing
but eventually they did come around
you are hereer in a stone each village
and so it's perfect for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
we're not donated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
there's no other way
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience as it relates cementering
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis that's getting worth day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new productor service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
ok we could make a mobileaiger counter
you can get volunteers
drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple of
imagine if we had across the country right now in multle places but
i have passion in my heart
it's just a walk
those of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
wells not yet
has a coherent movet
look at these pre3 structure
their faces broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will pay dividence
and in many cases we don't
but we all should
dan replies so often you won't even notice that
that wasn't the case for me
we all know what he's talking about it
no more charge before youe
and then something falls off the wall
i can hardly w
only one1 perc of the people who are actually farmers
talk to farmers
so what can we do
heres about false means
they don't get their money out
taking my child
she worked in a bank
i believe this story there has to be told
i have to reportd it
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
you and he said on the spot absolutely yes
he was smiling and we said go
we've been working together since since were kids really
which brought us to this

which means take my camera
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
iyed thin things i'm saying take my picture
things were going well
why are we skipping over this
this is a really important chapter to me
i understand this relationship
i went to the dean
you're doing incredibly important work
and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders
one year i came up with a bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the wors
you made it work for me
we know wh i kid don't learn
there's no need to play the market
i look at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the global level in
how could i let them down
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
it's always what it was and what it can be
let us have a hong kong nearby
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of story beforeit
i wasn't very good at reading things
we're on the grid
thanks very much
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarce that to help them

i don't paint
this is going to become really frea and obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad guys
again it will nott happen overnight

it needs to happen
is it heavy
we let other people worry about it
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
where would it go
you can experience their sense of place
who would i meet
shid i go there
the whole internet
i was looking for this thing that only fools seemed to look for
you can walk around them
you are all collective
but what is an idea drawing
and if it's completely ok tell you what's the jokees
here i'm one person cats to you
we just need to keep going
we don't need more's lw to continue
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence
and we have problems that we desperately need to solve
three billion people today with cell phes can't tax eeen e
don't create solutions to impress customers
so what did they do
why is it important now
and not just that
they met together
he was talking about the importance of coaching voys into men and changing the culture of the locker oom and giving
and let me just put this in context
and you know what else you did
and that's what we did
we met men where they were at and we built a program
why do i believe this
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of our spotghts
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still missing a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertisent council and we asked them to help us
this is your chance

you were born to
of those seven have noclear weapons

it's very hard to get up fororest
we're going to stay with them forever
and that interface is beautiful
and does it matter
i was suart of with interaction design
designers aspired to be really great designers
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
now it's like once again there is the whole problem of design being optens and the spool for art
what we want what we aspire to use the cold
i don't understand this
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
go i sat again sweat forming on my brown
for africans homebrown science fiction can be a will to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writings
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
it is in the water
it was fawulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
it is a marker of empathy
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language that used by real people have some
texting has developed one from this slash
that's what texting is
and so how did your brain give you that detail
i know i have
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
it using pasts experience based on similar situations to try to make meanings
i'm toolly surrian
not what is it
they are the basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
well that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we are going to go even deeper than the human body
when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob
they also monitor the internet and social media to monitor the progress of

the economy needs them
i wanted to understand who takes the job
whoull cleans up after us
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project with that
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
and this leaps to oudities
but this is the source of innovation
if we're still hungry we might have some more
we're not playing with each other
there's a l di ways toat piza
but if you want move we'll have no choice but to run you down
i went to extreme lengths that tred to be straight
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her

i will not be plained
one woman loses her head
faced with absence
one woman feeds on trash
my spine curved spiral
one woman gives birth two borders
i will crack my own drum
sickness health tender violence
i live cycles of life in darkness
one woman straps herself
where do refugee hearts go
clus the bombs left behind
one woman never did

my father works at this factory he sas
my grandfather worked at his factories

china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
we just need to act on it
well i didn't have any idea
it would be a mall and non apart
i had to have faith
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
how is that possible
they want it treatment
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
we are all responsible
but that's kind of a big problem
so after 25 years i began to feel asthough i was running dry
they're sit in them forever
how do i get through the hardest part
so momentum is good
and then what happens
often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest party

what are the researchers learning
i know i didn't
so i was jealous
then i thinick them a normal person
and i was really scared
but i found one
the ily is so obvious
that's next to impossible
so i went in that direction
but that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
what is dying for
i didn't know where i was
ra is a social category that have staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
and this idea is actually nothing news

you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people to try about how
if you want this experience to live on as something historic then if the perceptions

and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
let's have that
we don't trust them in
i do understand it
loons ever stud up before
it's a debate about words about metaphors
i don't know
you take it away disease comes back horrible diseases
it doesn't happen very much

getting a college education is a 20 year investment

what if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
you got unlucky

i would love to hear from me
the first lesson is about the reillity

this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region
but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
about a year after 9 11 researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
my other great passion is the environment
so let's get started now
i was considered a radical
i was living in my own apartment
i was no longer homeless
i didnt succeed
why are you really here
and i cried
i hadn't bathed in three days
i was winning awards
would you like to create a second one together
it's been thought about for a while
well i was surprised
they did not know this
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such braveen
some boys broken when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break the girl
i am full of contradictions
i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
i enjoyed fashion magazines and pretty things
they are gorgeous and headstrong gllliant girls who are a whole lot of braves
we have the right to reiss best
i want no part of any of that
i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given women feminism
it really is quite phenomenal
who or what inspires you and why
that's different from actually having an effective adication
5 day
how's that possible
that is great
thank you very much
how much they you
what do they have
do they have a common coal
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place

i'm a fifth generation texan
what do you do
i guess i'm doing it right now
do like flushier
i study shame

she said yeanhn
and here's what you need to know

have you lost your mind
i made a mistake
it' the deest way to shut people down on the airplane
he asked what do w they need to do to conform the female morms
we shouldn't be nationalistic
well there's a stlf fulfilling prophecy
you learned more about how comput this works
but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write
he wanted to keep s store
when you really look at how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
what is it that he messices
the whenom we got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems and they got home
how does that work
that's what so complicated about wark
it's not what i had expected
is incredibly hot
the boys who arere out there for a year
we have to answer that
they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strgicbly
and they don't need to ask permission
that's my question
what this guy talking about
let me illustrate this
this is completely design
that's a terrible waste of time
do that only if you are paid by the hour
now do just someth different that
that would not work
you're more cautious
it is the default option
and you walk around and it points to things
you just move away
now hamilton was everything madison was not
first they found it political parties
and they did it in the good old fashioned way
they change from to person
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing the moment in
she was doing ok
that was her fist
she learn about her riice
and 75 of them are women and children
she g and support networks
my own speciality is combining digital technologyies and imagine
it's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
it turns out the evidence says otherwise
it's a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
young people as well
let's help them pals
i'm not soop we did
we hear terrism
the silent majority does not need to be silented
if we hear the chaos of war
thank you very much
so they fel safe to come there
i sid we worked together
that's your grandfather
we didn't understand the program
tell me about that
they were all fight
and looked like the bld
and that's hld
i man never go to your house you may never come to my house
they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments and non prorofits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
this is possible
ev the one it is so hard
that's what happened look like thatad
they get scared to move
they get scared to walk around
my dad has alzheimer's disease
we're trying to become a beter person
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
they won the game
and the problem we're solving is what are those things
so bear with you
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i know platforms i no computers theyve put me on the internet when i was young i
a digital world farm
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
why didn't you just tell me thatack
what can i learn with you
did you find the gold
so that was easy
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
we were considered the real thing
so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are shrowing out
so that's it for now
that's allul right
and one activist actually got a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
it's just incredible
i was terrifyed
the same tool that united us to tople dictators
that's not to say it's impossible
growing up i was always intrigued by how people
again mets just play
i don't look differently
that don't probably happen every day
now i'm ready for my interview
i needed an education
did i get my upbradk
we must adoppt that way of giving back
i'm not sure
i was right he with you
5 years old
and i thought what am i thinking
it's not one la
and that's what i'm calling for here now
so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
so what do we do
we almost feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
do the same thing is worth
and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that we're takingen before something
he said yes
we were so excited
the agreeable people are warm and friendly nice of polite
they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
the answer to that question is very definitive
what your intentions toward others
it's all about what can you do for me
whereas giving and taking a more of your inner motives or your values
and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crafty products
and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming of question is a really complex
let's think about your ethical footprints
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
he's had a technology conference in florida
or do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably won't
we have to fix the internet
most independent media was shut down
now don't get me wrong
of course they wouldn't
i could make that decision
that's not an impropable cample
if you know about number
you can navigate spai
you saw him m that
it made me feel smart
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
i don't even know it's a real job title to be honest
its the coldest i've ever been
