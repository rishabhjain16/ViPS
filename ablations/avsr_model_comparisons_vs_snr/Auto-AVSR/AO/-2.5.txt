WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE'D LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
HE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE TAKEN BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THEY BEHAVE
IS USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANINGS
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M FULLY CURIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT BEING THE WORK IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOUR JOB IS CHANGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
LOCKS HAPPEN
SIMPLE YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK BACK
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE A BABY
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN THIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WE'RE GOING TO EAT THESE COWS
NOTHING EXCEPT THAT
IT'S NOT
MODEL
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
HE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IS GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
WHICH TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE GALS
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED AT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE INSTAGRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE THESE KIDS AND FAMILY CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THE MICROBE AFTER THE TRANSPLANT
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE THOUGHTS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME THINGS
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME NAME THEM BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S
THE SICK PEOPLE
IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
BUT THIS IS SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
IT SHOULDN'T BE NATURALISTIC
ECONOMY WON'T WORK THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THE PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
OR DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE MESSY GUYS
BUILDING CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FEATURES BROADCAST
AND THEN AT 11 O'CLOCK THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR WHO IS PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WOULD
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF
WE HAVE TO DECIDE
WHICH IS COMPLETELY
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP PRETTY HARD
I'M NOT A MILITARY BLACK
THEY SIGNED IT BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOME FORM OF REVENGE
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER WOULD BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
FIND A GOAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE
THEY WON THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
TAKE MY LIFE
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
MAKE ME FEEL SMART
ARE YOU STILL HERE MAN
WE DON'T USE AUDIO WE DON'T USE VIDEO
WHY ARE YOU
THE BOYS REMINDED ME OF HOME
I DON'T WANT TO
I SAID IN ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
1 TO GET TO DO THAT
FADED WITH THE JACKPOT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM IN THIS PRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES UP HORRIBLE DISEASE
WHAT ABOUT POLIO
LET'S HAVE THAT
FOR THE FIRST
WE DON'T TRUST THEM ENOUGH
THEY HAVE TO STOP
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY ABOUT BUILDING GOOD PRODUCTS NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY WOULDN'T
YOU WOULD BE GET THREE ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYTH
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED EIGHTEEN TO NINETY FOUR
HOW FAT ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE OF TRIVIAL MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
THINGS ARE AMAZING
SO WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH EVERYTHING
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE CREATION RARE DANGER REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
SOMETHING'S WRONG
GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO CELEBRATE
YOU'RE RECONCILING THE LIBERTY RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
KID WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT A CONTRADICTION
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB TITLE TO BE HONEST
THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX PEOPLE
WE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
BUT THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE LAW TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOP OF
IT CRACKED OPENED MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WALK THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T
HE WOULD HIDE IN THE CLOSET
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN THE DOG GETS OUTSIDE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DOG IS GETTING
HIS UH NAME IS LYING AND HE'S A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF COMMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU FEEL BAD
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR ON TELEVISION
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
BUT WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
WHEN I WAS TEN I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MOVING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BACK DOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAN REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGE BEFORE YOU
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
THAT'S MOBILE MANIPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT A LOT OF STUFF BECAUSE FORMING A IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD TAP INTO A WORKFORCE
I TAGGED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
HE WROTE THAT
ON WHICH
THE MEDIA REALLY ACKNOWLEDGED
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD A BEAUTY
AND BOY THEY WERE LIKE WHAT
YEAR HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW FORM
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
SORT OF BECOMING THE SYNTAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD USE
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND OF COURSE CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
DID YOU HEAR HE HAS GONE MAD
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
IT IS BEAUTIFUL
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORONER COULD FIND THESE THINGS
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH IT
ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED SAVINGS ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO
I'M 27 YEARS OLD
THAT
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT TO STAY IN THIS RELATIONSHIP
TO THINK WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY WE'VE GIVEN OVER THEM
I WENT TO THE DEAN
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO RIDE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
WE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
I WENT TO CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I COULD
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
FREE OF MAGIC
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 EMAILS
WEBSITE
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
WE SAW IT WRITTEN DOWN
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE EIGHTH GRADE COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
PUT THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
HE'S A BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
WELL YOU GET SEVERAL
THE GAS THAT THEY USE AT FIRST AND THEY PRODUCE OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
AND WHEN WE PUT AN IDEA RIGHT
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO ME
MORE COLLECTIVE
AND COMPLETELY OKAY WHAT TO GO
THEY CHANGE FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
IS TEN DEGREES BELOW ZERO
WITH LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP AND PROTECTION
TO DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN CANCER PATIENTS WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
AND SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
COULD BE MURDERED
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THANKS FOR ASKING
WHERE IS HE NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPECT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMAN FEMINISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADSTRONG BRILLIANT GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKE WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO TO BREAK A GIRL
I LEARNED TO WRITE LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE LIKE MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST NEED THAT PHRASE
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY'S BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL HOMES
THE TOP PREDATOR
THEY ARE READY
THAT I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
WE'LL START THERE
I MADE MORE MONEY
GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANT THE WORLD BANK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
THEY WANT A TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL GONE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
WE MIGHT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REASON HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOU'RE IN THERE
BUT THE SECOND OF THE CLIMATE WE HAVE TO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE COMEDY IN THE MIDDLE EAST
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING
AND IN THAT I NEED A SURGERY
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS FOR
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
WHO OR WHAT INSPIRED YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOK AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
CAN YOU PART THE BATTERY BACK UP
SOME GERMAN FRIENDS
4 TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH FOOD
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US WITH AWFUL DICTATORSHIP
I WOULD VERIFY
WHAT IS IT WORTH DYING FOR
THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WAS GETTING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
IT CHANGED THE WAY WE THOUGHT
THE BOARD OF
I HAD NO IDEA
THEY DON'T TRUST THE WORLD
WHY DON'T YOU CUT THE LAW
WITH DR
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIP FOR NOT EFFICIENT
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTIBIOTIC PROGRAM OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY DAD
MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED TO MOVE
TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
EVEN WHEN IT'S SO HARD
WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
IS IT THAT I LIKE VERY WELL
MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENT DEMANDING CHANGE WHAT THEY THINK PRESSING POVERTY WIDENING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS GROWTH
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IN DEFINED DEPARTMENT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT IT
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMIT OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN THE ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAIN TO OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUES
I DON'T HAVE IT
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THERE
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS SO BAD
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WOULD BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T ALWAYS SUCCEED
I HAD A BABY THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
THIS IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS GATHERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS I KNOW COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE IN NUTRITION
THE DIGITAL WORLD FARM
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
AND IT'S HAPPENING EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE YOU
IN VICTORY WORTH FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THEM
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW PASSIONATE THAT IS
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT THE PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS AND MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
TEXTING HAS A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S A NATURAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVE
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOTLINE
THE NAZIS INVADED THE NETHERLANDS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY
IT WAS LIKE A STAR TREK YOU KNOW
STARTED OPENING UGANDA
ON AT THE BACK
I'M IN TUCSON
WE HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOK FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO LIKE THAT AGAIN WHAT FORMING ON MY BROW
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITING
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICANS HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WORLD POWER
BUT IT'S IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN THE STOMACH FROM CANCER
WE DEFENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT THIRTY EIGHT PIECES OF NASTY EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF MUSIC PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM SOME SAFE PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES THAT
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE
IT'S JUST A WALK
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE MEANS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS REMAIN
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ IT FELT HELPFUL
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT RESILIENCE
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU
WHO'S AT THE EVENT
WHATEVER IT IS WITHOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
IT WAS A POEM
PAIN THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LUCK BEGINS
I REMEMBER MORE THAN 30 MINUTES
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVED ONE
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVED ONES
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID IN MY LIFE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WE CAN REALLY LOOK AT IS HOW RIGID THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING THIS TECHNOLOGY
WE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK
HE WANTED TO BE POOR
PEOPLE EVERYBODY
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILED
NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE TO AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUE IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
SUPREME COURT WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT NEEDS TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE HOLY SITE
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S PERFECT RIGHT
THEN THEY HAVE IT BRINGING IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATE
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING MADISON WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN A GOOD OLD FASHIONED WAY
FIRST THEY FOUND THIS POLITICAL PARTY
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY PEOPLE
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN
HOW FAR AWAY WE CAN COMPLAIN
THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
SPECIAL FIELD IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
DO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING IS LOOK AT THE AIR
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY ON BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROUSEL
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WHAT AM I THINKING
HE'S FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOU AND IT'S A NEW ARAB T
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BRIMSTONE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
THEN SHE'S LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING IT
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDER TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON THE COMPUTER
IT'S A COMPOSITE THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET TALKING TO SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED AS THEY ARE
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS IT EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORK
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AND OFF FOR ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACT
SO OBVIOUS
WE DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
I'M IN THE PEACEFUL RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FAULT
SHE GOT A SUPPORT NETWORK
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHTS
OF COURSE
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SUBTLE CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORK
IMAGINE JUGGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TOP
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO IT
BUT THEY'RE NOT
PEOPLE STARTED THINKING I DID
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT JUST DON'T HAVE DATA
IS COMING OF AGE TO BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER A BUNNY BEFORE IT RISES
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
GET THE WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WITH PRODUCT TODAY
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS IN A VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THAT THEY HAVE AGE
WE HAVE A COMMON COLD
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME GOOD NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T
WE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
TO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT DAILY FIRE TO THINK IT HAS
AND THEY DON'T NEED AS PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT
HOW DID THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT HE'S LIVING
WE HAVE TO ANSWER
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF THEM GOT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
YOU HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN HE HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST ONE
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE AT A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH DO YOU
AND RECONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO REALLY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
HOW STUFF MADE MEMORIES
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USABLE
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE PLAGUED
WE MOURN WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN REACHES HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FAITH WITH ABSENCE
MY FINE EARTH BIBLE
WHAT'S THE BOMB LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRUNK
THEY WILL SIT IN THEM FOREVER
OF THOSE SEVEN HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
I AM PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T A CAUSE OF INFLUENCE AT ALL
SO THAT WAS THE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TALK TO FARMERS
CASUAL FEET IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE BY REAL PEOPLE HAVE
TESTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS FLASH
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO THINK CRITICALLY
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED IT
YOU HAVE TO GET QUIET
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DISGUISE OF LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEAGUE DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
WE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DID SHE STAY
SHOW ABUSE TO LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT IN YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS IS TRUE
PRACTICE
ARE THEY AMAZING
REVENUE
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGE MY IMMEDIATE GOALS
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLANNING SO HARD HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
WE WERE BORN TODAY
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
CANNOT BE
YOU FEEL THE TAIL OF THE WALL
WE HEAR TERRORISM
THE SILENT AUTHORITY DOES NOT MOVE
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT
THEN WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE TIGER COUNTER
DRIVE AROUND
AND GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANKTON WITH NO FISH
AS AN INVENTOR I TRY AND TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET DRUG BENEFITS
IT'S AN UNTRUSTED PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PRODUCT
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW A PICTURE
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A HOMELESS SHELTER
5 DAYS
HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECT
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU VISITED
THAT I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY TO LOOK
PEOPLE EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEAT
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATE DAYDREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY DEFINITIVE
HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
THE THREE OF THEM PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY THEY'RE POLITE
WHEREAS EATING AND TAKING ARE MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVE AND YOUR VALUES
AND YOUR INTENTION TOWARD OTHERS
THEY'LL SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF NATURE SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTION
I WAS THOUGHT OF AN INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S PROBLEM OF DESIGN OFTEN
DESIGNERS OF FIVE REALLY GREAT DESIGN
WHAT WE WANT WHAT WE ASPIRE
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
THAT INTERFACE PAID BEAUTIFULLY
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE
NOW AT THAT TIME KANSAS NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMPUS DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A YELLOW CD AND THEY WOULD WRITE SOMETHING ON IT AND PUT IT UP ON IT
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUBJECT
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OPEN A AND IT WORKED FOR THE
WE TOOK CAMPUS OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY FORWARD
AND SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARNOLD FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT CAN HAVE EVERYTHING
THE IMPACT THAT YOU SAY
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA BY THE WAY YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION OUT
AND AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING A DEEPLY TERRIBLE JOB
THE REST OF BASEBALL CAP TWENTY YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST BE LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
I'LL BEGIN WITH FAMILY
REMEMBER CARLO
WANTED TO STAND THE ROOM THAT HE COULD PLAN ESCAPE ROUTE TO GET HIS HAND
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP ME
AND IT DOES
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS
I DON'T LOOK DIFFERENT ENOUGH
I'M NOT SURE
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MIAMI
I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH YOU
DID I GET MY UPGRADE
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY REPRIMANDED
EFFECTIVELY THE TALIBAN CREATES A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING SMOKING THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OBJECT
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONFIDENT
AND YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS TO THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WATCHING THEM
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
THREE BILLION PEOPLE TODAY WITH CELL PHONE TEN THOUSAND INTERNET
DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
CALLED FIRE
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT AND THEY ARE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
PART OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND
LOOK AT THE ANIMALS
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FOLLOWING IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD THIS DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MAKE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS IT
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
WE FIND HERE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES IT GET A BIT LIGHT
OR A FIREFLY
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
NOT HOW MUCH
MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVER
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON RIGHTS CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN EVER BEEN BEFORE
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING IN MOVEMENT WEARS OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE A HEALER IN A STONING VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITY COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSS TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER AT MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS WITH THOSE PAPERS OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO A POP
SO I WENT BACK
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT DOWN UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THEM
INVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH THEIR
AND SO I THINK THAT MEANS IT'S NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN OR WOMAN
WANT TO GO
I THOUGHT OH THE AMAZON
THEY BROKE UP
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S COLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
NOW I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WILL TAKE A JACKET
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
BUT I WOULD GO IN
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY GRAIL AND I ROSETTA STONE
AND NOW I LOVE
I KNEW NOTHING
AND THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANY MORE CAR
I HAD TO HAVE FAITH
IT WOULD BE A MALL NOT A PARK
IS ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFIT
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IT SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAY TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
NO MORE OF IT
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT TO BE STRATEGIC
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND TO BRING THEM TO THE TABLE
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRE COMPETITIVE
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND USE IT AS BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS POWERFUL
ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE THE STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GIVE THEM MONEY OUT
SHE WORKED IN A BANK
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
CARES ABOUT FALLING IN
WHICH INCIDENTALLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
THINGS GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
MIGHT GET A PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREEDING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER CHOICE
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION THAT YOU WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE IMPORTANCE
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I'M HERE
AND I WAS REALLY GOOD
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEM
IS IT ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE FINDING OIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
YOU NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW WE CAN SIDE WITH THE ANSWER
WE NOTICED WITH BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
JOLLY JEALOUS
I KNOW I DIDN'T
I THINK I'M A NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
IT'S LIKE IT'S
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO MAKE
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARED FOR THE HEALTH
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY DO WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
COVERING NOW
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND PULL AND POKE AND BOTHER
HOW DO YOU FIND A DIET
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
COME ON MAN
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU FEEL MUCH
THE POWER
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY GOT A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR THE SALE OF SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
BEGAN
WHY DID YOU BRING THAT UP
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAN
IT'S A DEATH WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN AIRPLANES
WHAT DO YOU DO
LIKE THE MACHINE

DO I FIND IT
I MADE A MISTAKE
BUT HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO CONFORM TO FEMALE MORE
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE ARTIST WORKING
I WAS A MEDIOCRE STUDENT
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTMENT
THIS IS NONSENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTION AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW BECOMING DIFFERENT
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE AN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CROWD
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA
THE UNEXPECTED PLEASURE
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE DID YOU LIVE
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS MEETS THE ODDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT WITH
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF THEY TALK LIKE VERY KIND SELL
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFFERENCE DID YOU SAY
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HEART MEET
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THIS IS NOT A PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A TWENTY YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GROW UP POOR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
I THOUGHT I WOULD DO THAT
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH AT STANFORD
PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
THIS WAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OUT
WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WAS A BIT UNCONVENTIONAL
I STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD THEM MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS THAT INTEREST
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING IT WORKS
PRETTY COOL
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMAN'S DAY WAS COMING UP
SO LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
HE BROKE IN THE BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAIL TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
HE NEVER WANTED TO TELL
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF US
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BAKER MODEL
THAT IS GREAT
AND WALK LIKE A BOWL
THAT'S YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
AND THAT
THEY WERE ALL RIGHT
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
AS THEY DO MORE TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITIES OF CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE'S AT A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN FLORIDA
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST INDEPENDENT MEDIA WOULD SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCK
BUT LINDA WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS EFFECTS
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM AT THE FIRST PLACE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES YOU DON'T
BUT WE ARE GOOD
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDENDS
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MALL
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOTS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS TO EAT PIZZA
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF PRIDE
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING HISTORIC THEN IF THE PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
COME OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION
YOU KNOW THEY DO BOTH RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES HOLD
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP GELS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROAD MAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE PRIDE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME
I WAS LIKE WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING ANY BECAUSE THE WASHER AND DRYER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROBABLE
YOU CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST LET BUSINESSES COMPETE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING ORCHARD
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT MADE
THEY FEEL AT HOME
