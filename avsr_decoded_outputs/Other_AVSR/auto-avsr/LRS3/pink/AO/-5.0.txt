WE ALL WELCOME
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE'D LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
YOU SIT ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY
HE WAS SMILING AND HE SAID
YEAH
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY PERIOD
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ASPECT
THE STUDENTS HAVE EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MEET
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTED US
I'M REALLY CURIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT PAYING THE WORK IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT

THE JOB
HE'S A GREAT GUY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
LUCK HAPPENED
SIMPLE YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TURN LOOK BACK
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE A BABY
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE

THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL FIELD
IT'S NORMAL

WE'VE DONE RESEARCH
WHO HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE ABOUT THEM
THEY TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE DOUBTS
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED AT HOME


AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT YOU PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE THIS PEACE AND FAMILY CYCLE
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THE MICROBE AFTER THE TRANSPLANT
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE THOUGHTS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE BIG THREE
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME NAME YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED PREPARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT

THE QUICK PEOPLE
WHAT IS HARD
WE'RE LOOKING FOR INDIVIDUALS
BUT THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY

WORK THOMAS JEFFERSON PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT'S JUST A TON OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
THAT WE THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD READ THE TRUTH
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND CAMEL
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
FOR NO MORE MEDICAL TIME
CLOTHING CAN BE LIKE
THEY'RE FACING BROADCAST
AND THEN AT 11 O'CLOCK WE STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THESE BLUE SHOES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR AND WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY DID
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF
WE HAVE TO

THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP TO THE
I'M ON MY WAY BACK
DECIDED BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOMETHING THEN
ONE WAS THE ASSAULT
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER

SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
FOR THAT DISEASE
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BUDGET
I WANT TO DO THIS
ONE GOAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THE
THEY WON THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
REALLY SMART
ARE YOU SURE HERE MAN
WE DON'T CHOOSE AUDIO WE DON'T CHOOSE VIDEO
WHY
THE VOICE REMINDED ME OF HOPE
I DIDN'T WANT TO
I SAID IN THE ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE I GUESS THAT WE NEEDED TO FIND
1 WHO GET TO DO THAT
DAVID WAS THE JACKPOT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM IN THIS PRACTICE

NOTHING HAPPENED VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
HORRIBLE DISEASE
WHAT ABOUT

FOR THEM ABOUT THE
WE DON'T TRUST ANYONE
YOU HAVE TO STOP
PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WORDS ABOUT MEDICARE
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY ABOUT BUILDING GOOD PRODUCTS NOW SERVICE
BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING
YOU WOULD BE DIFFERENT
THIS IS A REAL MYTH
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY NINETY FOUR
HOW FAT ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE LET'S KNOW THAT THE TRIVIA MATTERS
SO I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL PERIOD MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
WE WERE AMAZING
THE WHITE GUY
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH EVERYTHING
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE CREATION OF RARE PAINTING REQUIRES
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE EXACTLY WHAT TIME
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
SOMETHING WRONG
IT GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE OUGHT TO CELEBRATE
YOU'RE RECONCILING LIBERTY RIGHT
WE'RE LEFT WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT A COUNTRY WE THINK
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB TITLE TO BE HONEST
THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED
WE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE HERE THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
WILL THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
THEY DON'T NEED MORE MODERN
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE REALLY HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WALK THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEM THEY WON'T
YOU WOULD HIDE DEPOSIT
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN THE DOG GETS OUTSIDE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY EXERCISES ARE
HIS UH NAME IS BONNIE
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF COMMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU FEEL
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR OF
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
ONE OF THEM GOT PULLED UP IN THE WATER
BUT WE HAVE TEN CHILDREN

KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
WHEN I WAS TEN I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BACK DOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAN REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGE BEFORE YOU
AND THAT'S
WITHOUT MANIPULATION
FOR THAT MOBILE POPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND THINK ABOUT IT
AND THEY ALSO NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
I PACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET MORE OF THAT
HE WROTE THAT
I MENTIONED
THE MEDIA REALLY THOUGHT
I TRIED EVERY SINGLE
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXAMINE ALL MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD A BEAUTY
AND BOY THEY WERE LIKE WHAT
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW FORM
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
WHAT'S BECOMING THE IMPACT OF A NEW WRITER
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT COULD AND SHOULD DO
THIS IS WHAT I'M HOPING TO BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
THEY BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND OF COURSE CREATIVITY THAT SOCIAL BELIEF
DID YOU HEAR WE ARE BORN MAD
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
BEAUTIFUL
MY GOD
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A FOREIGNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS
AND REMEMBER THAT EXPERIENCE WITH IT
ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED SAVINGS ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO
I'M 27 YEARS OLD
GOD FOR
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULT OF THE SURPRISE
UNDERSTAND RELATIONSHIP
WELL
REALLY IMPORTANT TASK
WHY WAS IT GIVEN OVER
I WENT TO THE GYM
WE'RE HERE WITH THEM
IT'S NOT LIKE THINKING ABOUT A PRIVATE LIFE

PROJECT
WE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
I WENT TO CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I COULD
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE IMAGINE
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY HARD
I GOT ABOUT 3000 MILES
WEBSITE
KNOWING WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY PEOPLE
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW EVERYTHING ELSE
NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE EIGHTH GRADE COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART


HE'S A BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE BOTH BEHIND
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
WELL WE GET SEVERAL
THE GAS THAT THEY USE AT FIRST AND THEN PRODUCE OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
ALREADY
HERE I KNOW VERY IMPORTANT
MORE COLLECTIVE
AND WHAT TO GO
THEY CAME FROM PERSONAL PERSONAL
YOU DON'T TELL ME
AND DEGREE FOUR ZERO
LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP AND ACTIONS
DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN YOUR PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSAGE OF CHEMOTHERAPY
THE THEATER THE DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
MURDER
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THANK YOU
THAT WHERE IS NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGED THE ECONOMICS WITH THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO LOOK BACK
I'M PREGNANT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTION
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADSTRONG GORGEOUS GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKE ME I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW
I LEARNED TO FIGHT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO FIGHT LIKE MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY'S BRAIN
WALK AWAY

THE TOP PREDATOR


I WANT TO KNOW HOW I
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY
WHAT'S PERFECT
MADE MORE MONEY
GREAT
WE SEE AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANET WORLD BANK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
THEY WON'T BE FREE
WE ARE ALL HONEST
MY FATHER WORKED WITH THE FAMILY
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THE FACTORY
WE MIGHT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REASON HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I TRY ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY DID NOT BELIEVE IN MEN
IT ALLOWED ME TO
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING LIFE WITH ALL FORMS INCLUDING FOOD
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
WHEN YOU SAY ALL SYSTEM ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING WAS BROKEN
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T GIVE CREDIT OFF
YOUR ENGLISH
BUT THE SECOND OF THE CHALLENGE THE CLIMATE WE HAVE TO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
DON'T GET ME WRONG IT'S NOT LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY RELIEF
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING
IN THAT
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS FOR
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
WHO OR WHAT BY YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY ROOM FRIENDS
THAT MEANS
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOK AT PLAY
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
YOU PUT THE BATTERY BACK UP
THROUGH GERMANY AND FRANCE
4 TIMES THE NATIONAL SUN
SURELY WE KNOW
THE SAME THING THAT UNITED US THE AWFUL BEHAVIOR
I WOULD VERIFY
WHAT YOU WERE DYING FOR
THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE ALWAYS FIND THAT
WE WILL NOT BE
WHAT IS THAT
CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
WE CAME TO WHERE WE THOUGHT
TO DO THEM
NO IDEA
THEY DON'T TALK TOO MUCH
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THE LAW
THE DOCTOR
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER PATIENTS
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOT
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTIBIOTIC PROGRAM
HOW ELSE CAN YOU BREAK YOUR IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY DAD
MAYBE I'M ABOUT TO DO
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY WOULD CARE TO MOVE
TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
PEOPLE WANT IT SO HARD
WHAT I NEED NOW IS TOMORROW TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE
IS IT THAT I LIKE EVERYBODY
IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE CONFUSING RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENT DEMANDING CHANGE WITHIN
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING THIS TREMENDOUS BURDEN
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE WE DEFINE COMPARTMENT
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE MOST OF ALL WHAT IT'S MORE VALUABLE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMIT OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
LOCKED OURSELVES IN THE ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO RAISE OUR BRAIN IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUES
THEY DON'T HAVE
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THAT ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SO BAD
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
IT WILL BE INVISIBLE
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL COME
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I HAD A BABY FOR THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
THIS IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS GATHERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE
I KNOW PLATFORMS I KNOW COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG I
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE IN NUTRITION
THE DIGITAL WORLD MARKET
BUT NOT ONLY THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
HAPPENING EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE
PREDICTABLY
WHY DO I BELIEVE THEM
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW PASSIONATE THAT IS
SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING THE DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING THAT CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET THEM WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT THE PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF POKING BOYS AND CHANGING THE CULTURE AND GIVING
TEXTING HAS A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE THE NATURAL
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WITHOUT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TECH TOP LINE
THE NAZIS INVADED THE NETHERLANDS
WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER WE STILL FLY IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY MUSIC
IT LOOKS LIKE A STAR TREK YOU KNOW
GOT IT OPEN
OR NOT THE BACK
I'M IN TUCSON
WE HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HOPE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOK FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO WHAT FORMING ON MY BROW
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL RIGHTS
IT WAS FAULTY AND OVER THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE I WORKED
FOR AFRICAN HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTION TO BE A WILL TO POWER
OPEN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS FOUND A LUMP STOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE THE PHILOSOPHER
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT THIRTY EIGHT PEOPLE NASTY AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU FIRST
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM SOME SAFE PLACE
MATTER OF FACT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT BE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD THE COUNTRY
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE
IT'S JUST A WALK
I HAVE A PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
WHAT WE CAN BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE REMINDED THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S THE REASON

TOWARDS THE HEART
WE CAN ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
ARE YOU REGRET HOW HELPFUL
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT THE GROUP
BUT LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE
DO THAT WITH THEM
WHATEVER WHERE THEY FOUND THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AREA
GOOGLE
PAIN THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRE OF MY LOVE
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING THAT THEY LOVE ME
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVED ONE
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID IN MY LIFE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT HOW DID THE YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING THESE TECHNOLOGIES
WE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK
IN ORDER TO BE POOR
EVERYBODY
HE BOARDED THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILED
NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS FASTER
BUT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS NEVER SEE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE A SECOND
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE DEN IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
YOU LOOK LIKE MANTLE
OR ANY NATURAL LEADER
SUPREME COURT IS ALL WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT NEEDS TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS
THEY WERE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MIRRORS
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE SOUTHERN PART
I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK ME TO A FIRST
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING THAT
AND THEY DIDN'T PUT THE BILL BACK AWAY
FIRST THEY FOUND IT TO A BIG PARTY
THAT WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY
NOBODY COMES TO GET PAID
HARD COURAGE THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN
HOW FAR AWAY WE CAN FIND
NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
THAT WAS BUILT IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
DO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANT TO DO IN THIS BUILDING IS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT

I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY ON BACK FROM THE GROUND TO THE CHARACTER
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WHAT AM I THINKING
I'M FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT NEEDS FOR YOU AND IT'S A NEW ARAB
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND WINDSTONE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORK
LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND YOU THINK I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO A CLEAN LINK DESPITE THESE TRADES
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDER TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE YOU'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I I DON'T UNDERSTAND
YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING
IT'S A COMPOSITE THAT CONSTANTLY CHANGING BEING UPDATED
DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET TALKING TO SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH
HOW MUCH
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITOR THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS IT EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
YOU'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORK
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH RIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND WE PUT ON AND OFF THAT ALL HAD GONE
WHAT IF YOU HAVE ONE
SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
I'M COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU ARE
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM
THAT WAS HER FUN
SHE GOT A SUPPORT NETWORK
DEMAND ABOUT HER RIGHTS
OF COURSE
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE IN OUR FEDERAL CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE RUN WITH MAKING THINGS WORK
IMAGINE JUGGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE
AND LOOK AT THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THEM
DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE START TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU JUST DON'T HAVE DATA
COMING OF AGE TO BRING DATA INTO HUMANITARIAN
WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER AID FUNDING FOR A CRISIS
MADE IT DRIVE BETTER DECISIONS
DID THE WIND FOLLOW
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION WITHIN ITEMS
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKET TRACKING TECHNOLOGY IN THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
THE PRODUCT TODAY
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO WITH THAT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS IN A VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THEY HAVE AIDS
THEY HAVE COMMON COLD
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME GOOD NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
WE WANTED TO CREATE POLICY AT SEVENTY SEVEN
I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
YOU'LL PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING THAT DAILY FIRE TO THINK IT HAS FUTURE
AND THEY DON'T NEED ASPIRATION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GREAT JOB
THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HIGH
HOW DID THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOMEONE BROUGHT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE THE PROBLEM
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
HE HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN YOU HAVE YOUR CHOICE
JUST FOR THAT THE LAST ONE
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITY FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH DO YOU
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO REALLY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD
THE ANSWER WAS NO
BACK REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
HOW STUFF MADE MEMORIES
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL IN MUSIC
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE PLEASED
MORE IMPORTANT
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM AND HALF SILENCE
I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
FITNESS HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN IN HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE MINUTE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GAVE BIRTH TO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FAITH WITH ABSENCE
MY FINAL
PLUS THE BONDS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
FOREVER
OF THIRTY SEVEN HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
I AM PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
GOT ON LUCKY
WHAT IF WE DID THE CAUSE IF IT WASN'T THIS AT ALL
NOVEMBER
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
GO TO FARMING
CASUAL FEET IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
HE'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE THAT
TESTING HAS DEVELOPED FROM THIS FLASH
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO GO
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN
BUT IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO BE CRITICAL
HAVE YOU TURNED IT
YOU HAVE TO GET WIRED
OKAY
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY PSYCHOLOGICAL CRAFT DISGUISED OF ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT IVORY DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
WE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY THEY SHOULD STAY
SHOW YOU THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
NOW SINCE THEN I CELEBRATE WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT IN YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DO
AND WITH THIS GROUP
DOCTOR
IF I WOULD MAKE
REVENUE
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WOULD BE THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I THINK MY EVERYDAY GOALS
SO MOMENTUM IS GREAT
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLAYING SO HARD HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WITH HOW TO BELIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE
WE WERE BORN
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
I LOVE WHAT YOU DO
WE FEEL THE CHARACTER
YEAH
THE STYLE OF AUTHORITY DOES NOT MEAN
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT
OK THEN WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE GEIGER COUNTER
DRIVE AROUND
AND GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
REMEMBER WHERE LONG COVERED
NO PLANKTON NO FISH
AS AN ADVENTURE I TRY AND TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PRODUCT
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW A PICTURE
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THEY GO ALL THE WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
AND WE DON'T NOTICE THE FORMER SHELTER
FIVE DAYS

THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECT
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTRODUCTION OF PLACE TO VISIT
THAT I GO TO
WHO WOULD I BE
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY
EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
THEY WOULD GIVE A PIECE
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN YOU DO THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATE BEIJING WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY DEFINITIVE
THEY SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU DO
PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY
BREAK EVEN TAKING A MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVE VALUE
WE ARE ATTENTION TOWARD OTHERS
SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE
I WAS OFFERED AN INTERACTIVE DESIGN
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
ONCE AGAIN THERE'S
REALLY GREAT DESIGN
WHAT WE WANT WHAT WE DESIRE
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WOULD MAKE A LOT OF LOW LEVEL THERAPY ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER
AT THIS TIME TAMPA NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMPUS BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE THE YELLOW AND PUT IT UP ON
ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY
WE HAVE NO
WE HAVE BOTH OF THEM
IT WORKED FOR THE OPENING AND IT WORKED
WE TOOK HANDLING OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AT THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY
AND ALL OF THIS MATTER BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN
JUST WAITING FOR THE
AND FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME DOWN
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AS THE ARMY CAME BACK TO LOOK AT A LOT OF AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM I FEEL THE WAY THAT I GET ABOUT
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS
YOU CAN HAVE EVERYTHING
THE IMPACT THAT
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND ALL THE TIME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA BY THE WAY WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION
AND AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING A DEEPLY TERRIBLE JOB
THE RECIPE POPPED OUT 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT THAT
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE THEY WERE HIGH THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST BE LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST THEY ARE
HAVE DINNER WITH FAMILY
REMEMBER FOLLOW
WANTED TO THINK THAT HE COULD STAND THE ROOM PLAN ESCAPE ROUTE TO GET HIS HANDS
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP ME
AND IT DOES
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS THAT
I DON'T THINK THIS
I'M NOT SURE

I NEEDED
NOW I'M READY FOR MY ENERGY
I WOULD LIKE TO
WHEN I GET MY UPDATE
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE WILL
EFFECTIVELY THE TALIBAN CREATES A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT COST
HE DIDN'T MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE POPULAR
WE WALK AROUND AND POINT TO THE THINGS
THAT AGREE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WATCHING THEM
DO YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
WE BELIEVE PEOPLE TODAY
DON'T DO ANYTHING
WE ALL BUY IT
WE ARE RIGHT NOW WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING WITH A MAN IN THE VIDEO YOUR ANSWER
PART OF YOUR GROWTH RIGHT
NOW
THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL FORM
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FOLLOWING IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD THIS DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED THE GENERATION OF INNOVATION
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MAKE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
PLEASE LOOK AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
SO YOU FIND IT RIGHT NOW
WHY ARE YOU GETTING PEOPLE THAT LIKE
OR A FIREFLY
THAT'S POWERFUL
NOT HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC
AND OTHERS PRESENTED THIS CHARACTER RIGHT CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN EVER BEEN BEFORE
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WE'RE ABOUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE A HEALER
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY
AND SORT OF CLICK FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WILL BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
AND MY OWN SPECIALITY COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
HI
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSS TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER AT MY JOB I JUST UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS WITH THOSE PAPERS OR BY SIMPLY TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO A POP
SO I WENT BACK
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL TALENT THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THEM
ALL THE OTHER
AND SO I THINK IT MEANS IT'S NOT THAT
WONDER
OH THE AMAZON
THEY BROKE UP
THOSE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND WE CAN CREATE
AND I'M SURE THIS IS THE SAME OR ANOTHER
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
YOU JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENTS
NOW I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS ARE TAKING JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SO WATER IS SOMETHING THAT'S SCARY TO ME
WE GO IN
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND THIS BETWEEN WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOME STATE
AND NOW I WANT
NOTHING
AND THEN I THOUGHT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULD POSSIBLY HANDLE
I HAD TO HAVE FAITH
IT WOULD BE A BALL NOT
IS ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW COULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LEARN
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZATIONS
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL COFFEE BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IT SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY TWENTY PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAY TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
WITH NO MORE OF IT
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT GOT TO BE STRATEGIC
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A FREE COMPETITOR
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND USE IT THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CLOTHES
I BELIEVE THE STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GIVE THEM MONEY OUT
SHE WORKED IN THE BANK
RECORDED
HERE'S THE PROBLEM
WHICH INTERNALLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS A CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
THINK OF THE WAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH
MIGHT GET A FEAST FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
OR THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREEDING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER TERESA
THAT IS THE EMOTION
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE IMPORTANCE
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I'M HERE
AM I REALLY GOOD
BUT I'M SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT
ABOUT WISDOM
IS IT ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND WHO DRILLED DOZEN DRY WELL WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE FOR THEIR PURPOSE FINDING BOILING GAS
AND WE WOULD BE HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW DIFFERENT SIDES OF MATH
DID NOT JUST BE WITH BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CAR AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS

AND NO I DIDN'T

THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER THE PLACEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO YOU DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 50 HOURS
WHY DID YOU TURN
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARED FOR THE HEALTH
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PATIENT
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WILL WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT 2004

WHO'S GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
I DON'T KNOW
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW CAN WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND PULL AND POKE AND BOTHER
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE THEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY IS NOT INEVITABLE
DOUBLE MAG
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU KNOW WHAT
DO THE POWER
THANK YOU
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH PEOPLE
AND ONE AFTER THIS CONTRACT FROM THE WESTERN COMPANY SALES AVAILABLE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
YEAH
WHY IS HE DOING THAT
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION CAPTAIN
IT COULD DEFINITELY SHUT PEOPLE DOWN AIRPLANES
WHAT DO WE DO

AH
THE WIFE LEFT IT
I MADE A MISTAKE
THAT
TO ASK WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO ON THE FEMALE
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT PART OF WORKING
I WAS A NEW OPPORTUNITY
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTMENT
THIS IS NEUROSCIENCE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT COMPLAINING TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF
WE DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESS AS THE DEPOSITION
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTION AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE FLYING OFF
WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY
NOW IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE SO THAT OTHERS NOT HAVE
AND THEN GET ONE
TO LEVERAGE THE CHILD
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL NEEDS
THROUGH UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FARTHER
BEFORE WHERE SHE LEFT
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS IS THE ODDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
AND WHAT DIFFERENCES THEY TALK LIKE VERY KIND
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HEART MEET
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THIS IS NOT A PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IRRESPONSIBLE
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A TWENTY YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GROW UP POOR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW CAN I LET THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S LOVELY ALWAYS LIKE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE
I TEACH AT STANFORD
POSITION PRACTICING THE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
WHICH WAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
CAMP INSIDE OUT
LISTEN TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WASN'T FOR THEM
I STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD PULLED FROM MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING IF YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE
WHAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ONLY FEEL LIKE
SO WHAT DO WE DO
MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW

PEOPLE
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMAN'S DAY IS COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
AND BROKEN BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WANT THAT
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAIL CAN BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS A FREE TIME HOW PEOPLE THINK
THAT'S NOT THE SAFE AND POSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
HE NEVER WANTED TO
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF AND THEY WOULD BE EVEN MORE
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
I DIDN'T SAY THEIR MIND
THAT IS
AND WALK LIKE A DOG
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER
DON'T DO THAT
IN THAT WORLD
THEY WERE ALL TIGHT
SO WAIT OUT THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
AFTER YOU WALK TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY PROFESSOR AND HAD TO GO TO MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY MADE IT WORSE
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCES FOREIGN
YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST OF THE TIME HE WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO PICK VERIFICATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKS
THAT BRINGS YOU WITH LUCK
SHE FOUND US SHE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS AN EFFECT
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENT
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY OF SCIENCE OF MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN LIFE
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX THIS PERSON
WE ALL WANT TO
PROBLEM IN THE EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IS ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WORK
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENT NONPROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARGUMENTS THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY PEOPLE WE DON'T
BUT WE ARE GOOD
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDEND
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE BOTTOM
I KNOW IT WORKS
I GREW UP IN CUBA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOTS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE CROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
EAT PIZZA
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE A DIVORCE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF PRIDE
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT THING THAT YOU PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IT'S MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON IF SOMETHING THEN IF THE PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
COME OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLOP ORGANIZATION
THEY DO BOTH RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO GOES HOME
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE DEEP GELS
WE CAN NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN
THERE WAS NO ROADMAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY STOPPED
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME
I'LL GO
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING BECAUSE THE WASHING WIRE
LOOK AT THIS PREVIOUS STRUCTURE
HAS A BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT EVEN PROBABLE
WE CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
WE KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST BAD BUSINESS COMPETE
TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND DO TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAVE LONG
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DID IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING OLD KID
HOW WAS IT MADE
WHY YOU GET MARRIED
