WE REALLY DON'T WANT ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY NOT

WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS
NOT WHAT HE DID
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STATE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
HE SAID WHAT YOU READ
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
IT'S A GREAT GUY

BLOCKED HEAVEN NAMES
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK AT THAT UP
DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE A INTERVIEW
MORE JUST NOTHING
JUSTICE RESPONSE
WE DO WITH TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER
BECAUSE HE'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLE
THE END OF THIS HOUSE

IT'S NOT OPTIONAL
IT'S NOT A COUNTRY
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO DO

AND NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
THE ADULTS ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DID
OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED AND SAID OH
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
ONCE AGAIN
IN WHICH I DID THE DESIGN IN THE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE A FACING FAMILY CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANT
ACTUALLY STUDY HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE SONS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIND
NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPACE
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEN WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE TELESCOPE TODAY
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IS HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WHEN THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULD BE NATURALISTIC
THE PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IT'S RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M WITH ME
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD TO BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON
IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE BASIC GUYS
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCES
AND THEN AT A LIVING GARDEN THEY STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH A BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU ARE TRYING
I'M A PROFESSOR WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WOULD
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF
WE

THEY'RE LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP THE CAR
ABOUT A MILITARY BRAD
THEY STUDIED BECAUSE IT WAS SOME ADVANTAGE
ONE WOULD BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER ONE TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU MADE
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WORK CONTINUE REAL THING
AND THE WIDE DEGREES THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
IT'S FUNNY COOL
I CAN MAKE THAT DECISION
THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WANT THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKING ME LAUGH
HOW CAN YOU FEEL SMART
IT MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WE DON'T USE
HOW ARE YOU
THE BOYS ARE RUNNING ME OF HOME
I DON'T WANT TO
MY SON IN ARABIC
AFTER ALL
ONE PERCENT YOU GET TO DO THAT
THEY CAN GET THE JACKPOT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISS PRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND IT
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORRIBLE

LET'S HAVE THAT
THAT BEFORE
WE
IT HAS TO STOP IT
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING
BUT THAT REALLY
YOU REPEAT DOING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A WOMAN
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL COLLECTIVE TISSUE

HOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
THAT THEY DO
NOW IN ALL PERIODS ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU WANT TO DO MUCH LATER
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT CREATE THESE RARE GAP CHANGES REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF AT LEAST
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT IS
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING WRONG

THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE
HERE RECONCILIABLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE
DOES THE WATER STAY HERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE DOG THAN YOU
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL CASES
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WHILE THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
SHE WOULD HIDE CLOSET
THEY WANT TO KNOW
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISERS ARE
HIS NAME IS LANIA
FOR
FOR DEPRESSION AND WITH FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF DRAMA I TALK ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION

THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WORLD
YOU DON'T GET ASKED TO MESS THAT
ONE OF THEM GO HOME
PLUS WE HAVE TO GET
I WAS
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BAD DOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS
I DON'T PAY IT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DATA APPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALK
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGE BEFORE YOU
LET'S BACK
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S MOBILE MANIPULATION
I LOVE PITY ROBOTS
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN TO A WORKFORCE
WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF HOW WOULD IT KEEP ME ONE OF THEM
WHO WON'T FORGET
I'LL BE TOO FAR
THAT HE REALLY SAW
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I CAN EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD TO DO THINGS SOMETIMES
AND POOR THEY WERE LIKE
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW TOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
SO MUCH BECOMING THE SYNTAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND
THIS IS WHAT I'M TO DO
WHY IT'S NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
IT WAS LIKE
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND SUPPORT CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
DID YOU GET AUTOMATIC
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND THIS IS REALLY CRUCIAL
I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS A FAILED RECIPE
AND I REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 37
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF US
I'M 27 YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
AND WHEN WE DO THOSE
I WANT TO STAND THE RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WILL GO WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT JOB TO ME
WHY ARE WE COMING OVER THIS
I RECENTLY DID
BUT HERE'S THE THING
I TELL THEM HOW TO RIDE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
THAT'S THE PROJECT
WE HAVE TO TURN THAT WAY
SO WHAT THE CHURCH IS OFTEN EXACTLY GOOD
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VALUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE MAGIC
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT
I GOT ABOUT 3000
THE WEBSITE
SO WAS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WE WERE UNPREPARED
AND
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW IT
THE AGE WAY OF COMING
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE EYE
WHAT IS IT LIKE TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
THE BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN
WELL YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USE AT FIRST MEDICATIONS WITH OXYGEN

SO WHAT IS AN IDEAL
HERE ARE ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
THEY'RE ALL COLLECTIVE
UH COMPLETELY OKAY WHAT YOU DON'T
THEY CHANGE FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
WHAT IS 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
THERE'S LOVE AND THERE'S FRIENDSHIP AND
WHO DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
THE DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
TO EMERGE
THAT'S AWFUL
SO
THANKS FOR ASKING
I SAID WHERE IS HE NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGED THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPECT
I'M A FEMINISM
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO POWER OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOYED FASHION MAGAZINES
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM

SOME BOYS
I LEARNED TO WEIGH LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WAIT AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN CALL ME A LITTLE BIT BRAVE
WE SEE THE BABY BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES
IT'S THIS OPERATOR
I LOVE WE WORK
I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW THAT IMPACTS ME

I MADE MORE MONEY
THIS IS GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WAS NEVER WENT OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE
THEY WANT THAT TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
WHY NOT ASK ALL OF THESE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REASON HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THREE
CAN GET ONE
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BASING HAS GROWN
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST SEND IT OFF
KNOWING
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
DON'T COME ACROSS
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WELL
AND IN THAT I CAN CHOOSE TO REALIZE IT
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO THE WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START A HIGHER LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GREEN
YOU ALL WALK INSPIRES YOU WHY
I DEEPLY HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES

IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONDAY TO GLOBAL LEVELS
THESE ARE ONLY PARTICIPATORY BACKED UP
THE GERMANY IN FRANCE
FOUR TIMES

THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED
I WAS CERTIFIED
WHAT YOU WERE DYING FOR
THAT IS WHAT KIDS HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WOULD NOT BE THERE
WALKING DOWN
CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCK


THAT'S GREAT

WHY DON'T THEY TRUST THE GUARD
INTELLECTUAL
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ARE IN TELEVISION
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA
HOW ELSE WILL BE GREAT
SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY DAD
MY DAD IS OUR DOUBLE DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED TO WORK
I'M TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
EVEN WHEN IT'S SO HARD
WHAT I NEED NOW
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING

QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENT DEMANDING CHANGE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IN DEFINED
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF YEARS AGO
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN THE ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE'VE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRADE OUR BRAINS TO
I WILL HAVE IT
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THERE
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY AND A LEADERSHIP OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE
THE QUESTION IS YOU WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I HAD BAD NEWS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WEARING WARS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO

WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE NUTRITION
THE LITTLE WORLD FARM
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
THAT'S INSANE

THIS HAPPENED EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT SO GETTING
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USES WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE CAN
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW PASSIONATE ABOUT DATA
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF THOSE SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL HELMET
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
NEXT THING HAS A 100
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE IS THE ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT ONLINE
DID NOT EAT INFLATE THE NETHERLANDS
WITH MY PEOPLE
IT WAS LIKE A STARK

NOT THE BEST
HOW MUCH YOU SAW
YOU HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
I CANNOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I COULD HAVE THE FOUNDATION
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A WHILE
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SAY AGAIN TO WHAT FORMING ON MY BROW
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
TODAY'S VISION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITING
IT WAS FELT LIKE MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICAN
IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT
WE ARE SPENDING OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHAT ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BLOOD PRESSURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK I GOT 238 AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TURNED THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
IN FACT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
TECHNIQUES DO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MIGHT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR
YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
AND
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE CAN ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT
TRY LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU
GOOD AT THE EVENT
WHAT IT READS ABOUT THE PRISON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I AM USING IT
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU HERETIME


I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LIFE FOR ME
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW YOU BUILD THIS ONE
HE WANTED TO KEEP SURE
FOR EVERYBODY
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ACTION FAILS
NO ONE
THEY DREAMS UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON ABOUT NUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE LET OUTCOME
CHINESE CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH LAND AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THE EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A STANDARD ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
AND WE LIKE THE ANSWER

SUPREME COURT
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING ME
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON COUNTRY OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING
AND THEY DID IT IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY
FIRST THEY FOUND THESE POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE'RE MORE WORTH IT
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THEIR TIMES WHEN PEOPLE
HOW FAR WE RECEIVED THIS DRINK
THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POETRY
AND THIS IS A PROBLEM
BUT THIS WOULDN'T BOX
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
SO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MY SELF ESTEEM
I WAS JUST GIVING INSPIRATION TO MY JOB
THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIVE TO BE CARRYING ON BACK FROM THE GROUND
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
THAT WOULD BE THE CASE
WHAT'S MY VIEW
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
HAVE DONE VERSION VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOU AND A NEW ARAB TV CHANNEL
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRING WOMEN DON'T EITHER
THERE'S ANY EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD
AND YOUNGER AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
I CAN TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF A MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE GET
SO WHEN WE MET JOE WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OUR FEET
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHER SAID OH THIS IS RIDICULOUS
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THIS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OPERA ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT'S THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
NEXT WILL MOVE YOU
I'M NOT CRUCIAL BUT RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WOULD HER FIGHT
SHE DIED AND SUPPORT NETWORK
SHE LEARNED ABOUT IT RIGHT
SHE WAS DOING OK
WHAT IF THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOVE AND GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DON'T WE STUDY THIS ANYMORE
NO WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES
INDEED WE WANT THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DO THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA
IT'S INCOMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER EIGHT FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATING BACK AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WHICH BROUGHT US TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SOMEONE TO DO THAT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS
WHAT THEY HAVE
THEY HAVE AGE
THEY HAVE COMMON COLD
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK FOR THIS
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT COULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SO WE NEED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
YOU PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S THE SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS YOUR TIME
WE HAVE TO ISSUE THAT
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR

THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE NEW PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN IT HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE AT A TIME WITH THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES OF FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO WORK
AND RECONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE VERSION OF FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO OVER AS WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THE HOUSE OF IS MADE MEMORABLE
MORE LIKE TECHNOLOGY USEFUL UNUSABLE
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE IN PLACE
WE MORE WOMEN
AND IT WAS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE IT
STUDENTS' HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN LOSES HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
WHEN WOMEN DO THEIR FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO THE BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH SUPPORTERS
WHEN WOMEN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACED WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE
LAST TWO BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
OFFICE CONTAMINATED


IF YOU USE SEVEN
I AM PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
YOU GOTTA LIKE IT
WHAT IF OBESITY IS THE CAUSE
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
YOU'RE GOOD FOR THEM
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TESTING IS
EVEN MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE THAT'S USED BY REAL PEOPLE ASK THEM
TESTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE
WE CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO THINK REALLY
YOU HAVE
WE HAVE TO GET QUIET
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP
WHICH IS WHY THAT I
AND HERE'S ONE OF THOSE GUNS COME IN
HE KEPT ONE OF THE APARTMENT OF A CAR
I HAD TO GRADUATE FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DID SHE SAY
NO ABUSE THE LIFE DAY BY TALKING ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
I KNOW WHO I AM
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT TOGETHER
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT SHOULD I DO
AND
ARE THEY ATTRACTIVE


I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT
AND LOOKING THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TOO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
TO YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE NEED
WE ARE TERRORISM
THE TIME
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS

WE DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERED
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO
AS AN EVENT

IT'S AN UNTOUCHED PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND IT IS TO DRAW PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I CAN TELL YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL

THAT TODAY

THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECTIVE HAND CAMPAIGN
WHERE WE GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
SHOULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEAN
THE HOLY TREND
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
BUT LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT

IT WOULD KEEP A BEE
IT WAS DARK
IT WAS THE TOP
THAT AFFECTS ALL THESE
THINK OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES EVOLVED
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY INNOVATIVE
AND I SAID WELL I JUST CARED SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM MORE OF A CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FROM
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY THEY'RE NOT
WHEREAS TV TAKING
WE ARE INTENSE TOWARD OTHERS

AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO SEE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTIONS
IT DOESN'T MATTER
NOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN
NOT ASPIRE TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
BUT WE WANT
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
AND THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES
NOW AT THAT TIME CAME TO NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST INTERESTED IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CABINET POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A YELLOW
ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OAKLAND AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
WE TOOK CAMPING OFF THE TOP OF THE LENS
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE PUBLIC DAVID TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVINCED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DIALOGUE
AND 67 OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IT IMPACTS DENSITY
IT ABOUT CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION OUT
AND AT THE UP OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
SO LIKE THE BASEBALLS NOW
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
YOU TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUSING
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER ALL THOSE

I CAN CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
WE'RE GOING TO HELP
AND IT DOESN'T
DONATION YET
HOW
I'M NOT SURE
AGAIN THAT'S JUST PLAYING
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY INTERVIEW
I WILL TRY TO DO ONE DAY
CAN I GET MY UPGRADE

THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE
EFFECTIVELY THE DARPA TRADE A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
AND YOU WALK AROUND AND POINT TO THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T THESE PEOPLE WATCHING OUR HANDS

YOU ARE DOING YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR IT
IT MAKES SENSE OF THE PAST

DON'T CREATE TOOLS TO IMPRESS
WE ALL BE BIASED
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT THERE ALL
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING
ON YOUR STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END
SHE'S IN THE BEGINNING
BIGGEST GLOBAL PHENOMENA
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO STUDY
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY DREAM IS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT AND SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN IT RIGHT NOW
WHY
OR FIGHT
AND IT'S POWERFUL
I LOVE HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COMFORT
OTHERS REJECTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAY RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL
THAT WOULD REALLY TELL
EVERYTHING
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY KNOW THAT
THOSE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE HERE SO NICE VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
UNTIL IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
AND WE ALWAYS MICHELLE IT
I AM SEEING YOU MY STOMACH
HOW
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THEIR BOSSES TO WRITE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING BUSINESS AND GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BALANCES
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT DOWN GREEN UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS

AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT
I WOULD GO
AND I WAS LIKE OH THAT AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID GIVES THEIR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
NOW I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WALL
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE GETTING JAPANESE
SO WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS
SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
BUT WE'RE GOING
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
LIKE EVERYTHING

NOW I LOVE LANGUAGE
I KNEW NOTHING
THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T LOVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULD POSSIBLY HATE ANY MORE CARS
I HAD CAFFEINE
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
IT'S ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT

THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 OF AMERICANS
HOW CAN YOU CONFORM
WE MAKE TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OF IT
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS UP
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A BREEDING BENEFIT
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DIDN'T OPEN UP
AND YOU DECIDE BIRTHDAY
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WOULD BE POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
WAIT A MINUTE
THAT'S MY CHILD
I BELIEVE THE STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
YOU WERE STILL PAYING
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
WHO CARES ABOUT BOSTON

I DON'T MEAN LIVING

THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKING GREAT
MAKING THE WAY UP
MAKE IT GO AWAY
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT

WELL NOT YET
THAT'S GOING TO BE
SO WHAT
THAT IS SOME DEEP EMOTION WHETHER WE WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I'M HERE
AND I WAS THERE
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANTED OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
IT'S ABOUT QUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING LIKE THE BREED CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND WHO DRILLED
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THE PURPOSE
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE
WE ALL GO DEEP INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE GOT SINCE WE WERE BABIES

WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
I HAD NO IDEA

THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAID YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WHAT ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION
HE ALSO HAD A LOVING TRUTH
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS

GOODIES ARE GOING
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME
I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
COMING UP
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY BAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME ACROSS
HOW CAN WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND PULL AND BLOW AND BREATH
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE PASSION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
CHEMICAL BANKS
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
THEY
WE WOULDN'T TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY DID YOU BRING THIS UP
HAVE YOU LAUNCHED THE MIND
I'M GOING TO FIFTH GENERATION NEXT
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I SAID JAM
AS I'M
YOUR WIFE LEFT IT
I MADE A MISTAKE
HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO
I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WOULD SAY MEDIAL
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY ADVENTURE ON AMAZON
THIS IS NONSENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME
I WISH
I GET IN A CAR
I WAS ABOUT TO FIND
SEXUAL GRASP IS DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS

THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT
NOW IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT NOW
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DO WE LEVERAGE THAT

THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LEFT
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A TIP OF WATER
AND THIS IS THE ODDITY
BUT THIS IS A SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN

I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WHAT DIFFERENCES MAKE
AND SO WE CAN DO BETTER AND COPY THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET
WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
IT IS NOT PUT OUT OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT IS POSSIBLE
I WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
SO
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO ON BOARD YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW CAN I LET THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS DAMAGED THEIR GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT
I THINK THE STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN OF PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING RITUAL
YOU KNOW

WE LISTEN TO OUR EYES
AFTER ALL I WASN'T
I STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
PEOPLE
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY EMBARRASSED THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THAT ONE DAY
WOMEN'S SERIES COMING UP
LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
TAKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAILS TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS DREAMING HOW PEOPLE
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF INTENTION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BAKER MODEL
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
LET IT GO
THAT'S THE GRANDFATHER
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S HOPE
THEY WERE ALL WHITE
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
I THINK WE WANT THAT
I MAY NEVER HOLD YOUR HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY
AND IT IS
WITHOUT THEM
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE'S DONE TECHNOLOGY
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
DO I THINK WE ARE ABOUT OURSELVES ACTUALLY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT'S SO NO BLOCKAGES
BUT THIS WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TWO MEN AND WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST WRONG IN AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORLD
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM AT THE ALIEN EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST A VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
LIKE YOU ARE THE WAY
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS
AND IN MANY KIDS WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAY ACTIVITIES
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST GET HOME
CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MAS
I KNOW WHAT IT WORKS

THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN DO WEALTHY ARABATORISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE INVASIVE A BOOMING CENTURY ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONVERSATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE ARE THE MILLIONS OF WAYS TO EAT MEAT
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF CRIMES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE YOU PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IT'S MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE THAT
COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLOP ORGANIZATION
THEY DO POLLS RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE
SO I LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP SHELLS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN
THE WORDS DON'T ROADMAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA IS NOT DONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
I DON'T
BUT I GO
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE A TRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I WAS LIKE WHAT
WHAT ABOUT TRUTH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
AS A CHORAL MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROBABLE TIP
YOU CAN HAVE A SPEECH
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST GET BUSINESSES COMPLETE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND DECORATING SIDE TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE AT HOME VIRTUAL PARTIES
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING ORIGIN
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT AMAZING
THEY FEEL AT HOME
