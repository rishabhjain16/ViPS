WE REALLY DON'T WANT ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M LOOKING OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE'D LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD
AND HE DID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT HE DID
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORED YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STATE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
HE SAID WHAT DO YOU READ
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY

BLOCKED THEM
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK AT THAT UP
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE A INTERVIEW
MORE JUST IS NOTHING
JUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRY TO IMPROVE JUST
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLE
FOR THE END OF THIS HOUSE

IT'S NOT OPTIONAL
IT'S NOT A COUNTRY
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS

WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO NEED TO GET OUT
OFTEN I RECOGNIZE IT AND SAY NO
I'M NOT SURE WHAT
ONCE AGAIN
IN WHICH I DID THE DESIGN IN THE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE A DEFENSIVE FAMILY STATUS
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANT
ACTUALLY STUDY HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE TONS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIND
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEY CAN GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE TELESCOPE TODAY
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WHEN THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY
THE PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IT'S RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD READ THE DOUBLE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M WITH ME
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD TO BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON
IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE BASIC CUTS
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCES
AND THEN AT A LIVING GARDEN THEY STOPPED TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
DO YOU TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WOULD
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUTRAGE PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS

THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP THE CAR
ABOUT A MILITARY BRAT
THEY DECIDED BECAUSE THEY WANT SOME FORM OF REVENGE
ONE WOULD BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER ONE TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU MADE
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WORK CONTINUE TO DO REAL THING
AND THE WIDE DEGREES THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE THE STUDY OF ATTENTION
IT'S VERY COOL
I CAN MAKE THAT DECISION
THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WANT THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LAUGH
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
IT MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WE DON'T USE AUDIO WE DON'T USE FAILURE
HOW ARE YOU
THE BOYS ARE RUNNING A BIT OF HOME
I DON'T WANT TO
MY SON IN ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE THAT WE NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO GO HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GET TO DO THAT
THEY CAN GET THE JACKPOT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISS PRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND IT
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
AND YOU KNOW
TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORRIBLE DISEASES
WHAT ABOUT
LET'S HAVE THAT
THAT BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST DEMAND
IT HAS TO STOP
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SURFACE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU REPEAT DOING ORDERS FROM ABOVE

AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL COLLECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY EXAMPLE WAS AGED 1894
HOW SAD ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE OF TRIVIAL MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT
NOW IN ALL PERIODS ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU WANT TO DO MUCH LIKE THEM
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT IS
I HAVE TO TAKE YOU OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
IT WAS JUST SOMETHING WRONG

THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAD TO CELEBRATE
HE'LL RECONCILIABLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT ARE YOUR RELIGION
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S REAL JOB YET TO BE HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
DOES THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE TARGET THAN YOU
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL CASES
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WHILE THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
SHE WOULD HIDE THE CLOSET
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU START
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISERS ARE EXCITED
HIS NAME IS LANIA
FOR HEPATIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND
FOR DEPRESSION AND WITH FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE WE TALK ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE SO THAT REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
WE IMAGINE WALKING ON THE FLOOR AND YOU SEE A
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WORLD
YOU DON'T GET US TO MYSELF
ONE OF THEM GO HOME
PLUS WE HAVE THE TEMPERATURES
I WAS ABLE TO DO
I KNOW I WAS WONDERFUL TEN PEOPLE
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BACK DOORS
HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMILY FISHING OPTION
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DATA APPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALK
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGE BEFORE YOU
LET'S BUY
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S MOBILE MANIPULATION
I LOVE PITY ROBOTS
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FORMING A QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD TAP INTO A WORKFORCE
I TAGGED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WOULD KEEP ME ONE OF THEM
YOU WON'T FORGET
I'LL BE TOO FAR
THAT HE REALLY SAW
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD TO DO THINGS SOMETIMES
AND MORE THEY WERE LIKE WEAK
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW TOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
SO MUCH BECOMING THE SYNTACS OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND THAT'S THE SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD DO
THIS IS WHAT I'M TO BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IT'S NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE LIKE
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND SUPPORT CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
DID YOU GET YET AUTOMATICALLY
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND THIS IS REALLY CRUCIAL
SO I WENT TO MY DAUGHTER
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS A FAILED RECIPE
AND I REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH US
ROUGHLY 37 SCENARIOS INVOLVED ROUGHLY 600
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF US
I'M 27 YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
AND WHEN WE DO THE DOCTOR
I WANT TO SAY THE RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WILL GO WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT JOB TO ME
WHY ARE WE COMING OVER THIS
I WENT TO THE DAY
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S ONLY TEACHING THEM HOW TO RIDE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT'S WHAT A PIECE OF THIS PROJECT
WE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHAT THE CHURCH IS OFTEN EXACTLY GOOD
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VALUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE MAGIC
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000
MY WEBSITE
SO HE WAS WORTH ONE AND WHEN
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WE WERE UNPREPARED WE OVER YET
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND GREAT IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE THOUGHT
NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S A SORT OF THE STATE OF THE EYE
WHAT IS IT LIKE TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
THE BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN
WELL YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USE AT FIRST IN MEDICATIONS WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY HAD AN OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
SO WHAT IS IT IDEAL
HERE ARE ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
THERE ARE COLLECTIVE
AND EVEN COMPLETELY OKAY WHAT YOU DON'T
THEY CHANGE FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
WHAT IS 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
THERE'S LOVE AND THERE'S FRIENDSHIP AND
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE THINK IT IS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
TO EMERGE
THAT'S AWFUL
SO
THANKS FOR ASKING
I SAID WHERE IS HE NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGED THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPECT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I'M FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO POWER OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOYED FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY FUN
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG
I LEARNED TO WEIGH LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WAIT AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST
WE SEE THE BABY'S BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES
IT'S THIS OPERATOR
I LOVE WE WORK
I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
I MADE MORE MONEY
THIS IS GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLATE
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WAS NEVER WENT OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE
THEY WANT THAT DREAM
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
WHY CAN'T I ASK ALL OF THESE DATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REASON HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THREE

SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH PATIENT HAS GROWN
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST SEND IT OFF
KNOWING
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE DIDN'T SEE HOW TO DO THAT
DON'T HAVE COMMON ENEMIES
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WELL
AND IN THAT
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO THE WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WHAT ON THE GREEN
YOU OR WHAT INSPIRES YOU WHY
I DEEPLY HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES

IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
THESE ARE ONLY PARTICIPATORY BACKED UP
THE GERMANY IN FRANCE
FOUR TIMES THE MASSIVE
SURELY WE'RE GOING OFF
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US
I WAS THIRTIFIED
WHAT YOU WERE DYING FOR
THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
WHAT IS THAT
CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCK
IT'S THE WAY WE TALK
TO PROVE THAT
IT'S GREAT
THEY DON'T TRUST THE LAW
WHY DON'T THEY TRUST A LOT
INTELLECTUAL
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT A VISION
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST
HOW DO WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY DAD
MY DAD IS OUR DOUBLE DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED TO MOVE
I'M TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
EVEN WHEN IT'S SO HARD
HOW CAN YOU NOW HAVE STILL LEARNED TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
IS IT THAT I LIKE TO ANYBODY
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEPER
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENT DEMANDING CHANGE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST TRAGIC POVERTY WIDENING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IN DEFINED COMPARTMENTS THESE DAYS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN THE ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE'VE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
I WILL HAVE ANYTHING
I DON'T KNOW
THE FIRE IS THERE
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CRYPTOCITY
THE QUESTION IS YOU WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
I HAD BABIES
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING WARS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RATE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS DAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO

WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE AND NUTRITION
I THINK YOU'RE A WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING

THIS HAPPENED EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT SO GETTING
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM THE AGE
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE DID
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW PASSIONATE ABOUT DATA
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF THOSE SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL HELMET
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS IN THE MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
TESTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN GROUND
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE IS THE ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD THE CRISIS TEXT ONLINE
THE NAZIS INVADED THE NETHERLANDS
WITH MY

I STARTED OPENING THE GROUND
NOT THE BEST
HOW MUCH YOU SAW
YOU HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
I CANNOT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
BY THE GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SAY AGAIN WHAT FORMING IN MY BROW
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITING
IT WAS FELT IN MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICAN HOMEBOAT AND FAVOR IN MIDWILL POWER
IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN A STOMACH TUMOR CANCER
WE EXPANDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK I GOT 238 AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
IN FACT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
SIMPLY IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BODIES IN THE END
YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE CAN ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT COMMUNITY
TRY AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU
GOOD AT THE EVENT
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THEIR PRISON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I KEPT USING IT MADE THE FEAR
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
HERE IS THE POLL
BEING RUN THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FILES OF MY LOVE VIDEO
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LIFE FOR ME
I AM TOTALLY
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE
AND ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE DO THE YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW YOU BUILD THIS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP SURE
FOR EVERYBODY
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLACE GETS OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT NOT ABOUT NUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINESE CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LANDED ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
AND WE LIKE THAT
WE NEED NATIONAL
SUPREME COURT AS FAR AWAY DOWN FROM WHAT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCENTS
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF BEARS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ARE COUNTRY OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING MEDICINE WAS CAUGHT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY
FIRST THEY FOUND THESE POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE MORE WANT THIS
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THEIR TIMES WHEN PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEE EYE
HOW FAR WE RECEIVED THIS DRINK
THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL APPROACH
AND THIS IS HIS PROBLEM
BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
SO THAT ONLY IF YOU PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MY SELF ESTEEM
I WOULD JUST EVEN INSPIRATION THAT MY JOB
THROUGHOUT YOUR CHILDREN'S
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY ON BACK FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROUSEL
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
THAT WOULD MAKE THE CASE
WHAT'S MY VIEW GOAL
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DONE VERSION VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOU AND A NEW ARAB TV CHANNEL
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRING WOMEN DON'T EITHER
THAT ENDED HERE IN THE WORLD
AND LOOKING AT YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE FOR TWO MONTHS WHAT I WAS DOING
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT END SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THESE
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING IN WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF A MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET JOE WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OUR FEET
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHER SAID NO THIS IS RIDICULOUS
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITOR THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORST
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OPERA ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT'S THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT WILL MOVE YOU
I'M NOT CRUCIAL BUT RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WOULD HER FIGHT
SHE GOT AND SUPPORT NETWORK
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHT
SHE WAS DOING OK
WHAT IF THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVEL AND GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DON'T WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHANGING CLIMATE
INDEED WE WANT THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE DUGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TOP
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MEANT LATER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DO THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA
IT'S INCOMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER AID FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATING BACK AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WHICH BROUGHT US TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO WITH THAT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS
WHAT THEY HAVE
THEY HAVE AGE
THEY HAVE COMMON CORE
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
SOMEONE WHO HAVE THAT KIND OF AUTISTIC POTENTIAL
TAKE A LOOK AT FOR THIS
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT COULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SO WE NEED TO CHANGE PAKISTAN THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
YOU PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT GETTING FIRED THEY CAN HAVE TRADITIONALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT DONE
WE HAVE TO HIT YOU THAT
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF GOD OUT OF THE ARMY HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOMES
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN HE HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE AT A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO WORK
AND RECONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
I DIDN'T KNOW
SO TO SUM RIGHT IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THE SOUND STUFF IS MADE MEMORABLE
WHAT MAKE TECHNOLOGY USEFUL UNUSABLE
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE IN PLACE
WE MORE WOMEN
AND IT WAS ECHOES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
TURKEY'S HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN LOSES HER HAND
ONE WOMAN FITS ON TRASH
WHEN WOMEN DO THEIR FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO THE BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO BORDERS
WHEN WOMEN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEES GO
FACED WITH HAPPINESS
MY SPINE TOOK VERY POWERFUL
LET'S DO MOMS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS
THEY WERE TAKING YOU FOREVER
OF THOSE SEVEN AND
I'M PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
YOU GOTTA LIKE IT
WHAT IF OBESITY IS THE CAUSE
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED
ARE YOU ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
YOU'RE GOOD FOR THEM
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TESTING IS
EVEN MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE THAT'S USED BY REAL PEOPLE ASK THEM
TESTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE SMOKED LEARN
WE CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WOMEN THINK REALLY
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WE HAVE TO GET QUIET
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP
WHICH IS WHY
AND HERE'S ONE OF THOSE GUNS COME IN
HE KEPT ONE OF THE APARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DID SHE SAY
NO ABUSE DELAY OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS HAVE
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL

SO SINCE THEN I'VE WALKED OVER ME
WHAT ANOTHER MAN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT SHOULD I DO
AND
ARE THEY ATTRACTIVE

I
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE WHOLE 10000 PHASES
THE MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLAYING SO HARD FOR HOW DO WE GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TOO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
TO YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE CAN HANDLE THE WAR
WE ARE TERRORISM
THE TIME MAJORITY DID NOT NEED TO BE TIRED
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WE ALL KNOW THIS
OK WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE ANGLE OUT
WE DRIVE AROUND
WE DID HAVE OUR YEARS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PRACTICAL MEANS NO FISH
AS AN ADVENTURE AND FANTASY IS REALITY
NOW WE DO GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNHUNTED PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW PICTURES
AND THESE IDEAS ARE NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I CAN DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL

FIVE YEARS A DAY
WHERE'S THAT POSSIBLE
THAT DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECTIVE HAND CAMPAIGN
WHERE WE GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE EXACT PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
SHOULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE HOLY DRESS
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOD SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
BUT LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
JUST NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD BE
IT WAS DARK
IT WAS THE TIME
THAT AFFECTS ALL THESE
THINK OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY INNOVATIVE
AND I SAID WELL I JUST CARED SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM MORE OF A CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FROM THEM
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY THEY'RE NOT
WHEREAS TV TAKING MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES
WE ARE A TENDENCY TOWARD OTHERS
THE DAMN SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SEX AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO THE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTIONS
AND DOES IT MATTER

DECIDED TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIRES
BUT WE WANT
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE ORDER FROM OUR OFFICE
NOW AT THAT TIME CAME TO NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST INTERESTED IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CABINET POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A YELLOW CITY AND THEY WOULD WRITE SOME DATA AND PUT IT UP ON THE BOARD
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OAKLAND AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
WE TOOK CAMPING OFF THE TOP OF THE LATEST AS THE MOST INTERESTED IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE PUBLIC DAVID TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DYING CORNER
AND 67 OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE AUTHOR OF FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FELT THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IT IMPACTS DENSITY
IT ABOUT CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO GENDERS AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL STAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION OUT
AND AT THE UP OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY LIKE THE BASEBALLS NOW 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUSING
HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER CALLING
HE WANTED TO GET HIS HAND
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP
AND IT DOESN'T
THE DONATION IS AFRICAN

I'M NOT SURE
AGAIN THAT'S DISPLAYING
I NEEDED ON EDUCATION
NOW I'M
I WILL TRY TO DO ONE THING
CAN I GET MY UPGRADE
WE MUST THINK THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS
EFFECTIVELY THE DARBY TRADE A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'D LIKE TO CONSIDER YOU
SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE TAKES OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
AND YOU WALK AROUND AND POINT TO THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY ARE THESE PEOPLE WATCHING OUR HANDS

DID YOU LEARN TO WHAT YOUR NEXT DAY DO
BUT I LOVE IT FOR IT
IT MAKES SENSE OF THE PAST
WE MAKE PEOPLE FEEL ABLE TO TAKE
DON'T CREATE TOOLS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE ALL BE BIASED
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT THERE ARE
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE TO ENTER
ARTICLE YOUR STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE ANIMAL
SHE'S IN THE BEGINNING
BIGGEST GLOBAL PHENOMENA
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO STUDY COVER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION YOU CAN BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP EVER GOT
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT AND SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE DIE THERE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES IT TAKE A VISIBLE LIFE
OR FIGHTER FLYING
AND IT'S POWERFUL
I LOVE HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COMFORT
OTHERS REJECTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAY RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST A
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN IT EVER BEEN RECORDED
THAT WE REALLY YELL AT THEM
EVERYTHING YOU USE IS THAT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY KNOW THAT MEANING
THEY'RE DOING AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ONE
YOU ARE HERE SO NICE VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
IS IT PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
CAN WE ALSO BE JEALOUS BY THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THEIR BOSSES TO WRITE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING BUSINESS AND GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BALANCES
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS IT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICES
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT DOWN GREEN UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
CAN WE EVOLVE ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN OR WOMAN
I WANT TO GO
AND I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID GIVES THEIR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WALL
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
SO WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT'S GIVEN TO ME
BUT WE'RE GOING
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND
AND I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY
NOW I LOVE LANGUAGE
I DO NOTHING
THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULD POSSIBLY HATE ANY MORE CARS
I HAD CAFES
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
IT'S ABOUT HURTING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WOULD READ
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 OF AMERICANS
HOW ARE YOU INFORMED
WE PAY TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OF IT
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING
SO WE NEED THE ANALYSIS TO GET IT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
SO WHAT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TABLE
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A BREEDING BENEFIT
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DIDN'T OPEN UP
AND YOU DID THAT BIRTHDAY
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WOULD BE POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
WHAT DO YOU NEED
DID MY CHILD
I BELIEVE THE STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
YOU WERE STILL BANG
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
WHO CARES ABOUT BOSTON
WHICH IS NOT ONLY A THIRD CORRECT
I DON'T BE GIVING UP THE INTERNET
DID YOU DO THIS
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME

MAKING THE WAY UP
MEANINGFUL WAY
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT
YOU MIGHT GET A PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREEDING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WHAT MOTHER IS GREAT
THAT IS SOME DEEP EMOTION WHETHER WE WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
DYING IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GO OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENTARY
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
IT'S ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM PRETTY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIEND WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WHALES RUNNING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THE PURPOSE
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THE POINT OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW DEEP INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE NOTICED WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN A CAR AND WE DRIVE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
I HAD NO IDEA
THAT I'M A NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S IT FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAID YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WHAT ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY DON'T WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD A LOVING TRUTH
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO
YOU NEED TO AGREE
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND
IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME ACROSS
HOW CAN WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND POOL AND BOAT AND BREATH
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE PASSION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE AND THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
CHEMICAL MAILS
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SPEND MONEY
WE WOULDN'T TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY DID YOU BRING THIS UP
HAVE YOU LAUNCHED THE MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAS
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I SAID JAM
AND AS I'M DOING IT RIGHT
YOUR WIFE LEFT IT
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO YOU FORM THE FEMALE NORMS
I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS AT MEDIOCRE SCHOOLS
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR ON AMAZON
THIS IS NONSENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND EDITING AND SHAME
I WONDER WHY
I GET IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL GRASPING DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS

THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF THE DOOR BEFORE
NOW WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT NOW
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE IT LOUD
SO WHY DO WE HAVE TO SHARE
BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES HE GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE DOES HE LOVE
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FIRST TIP OF WATER
AND THIS IS THE AUDIENCE
BUT THIS IS A SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WANT TO MAINTAIN

I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WHAT DIFFERENCES MAKE
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER
WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
IT IS NOT PUT OUT OF ANYONE
IT IS ONE
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE
I WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOMING
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO ON BOARD YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW CAN I LET THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS DAMAGED THEIR GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
AND HE'S A STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN IN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE USING RITUAL

AND INSIDE OUT
AND WE LISTEN TO OUR EYES
AFTER ALL I WASN'T BEING
I STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BEST INTEREST
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T REVEAL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
PEOPLE
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY EMBARRASSED THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN
WOMEN'S SERIES COMING UP
LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT DOG FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S A LEGACY HAPPENED WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
TAKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAIL TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WOULD ALWAYS DREAM BY HOW PEOPLE
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF ENGAGING AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BAKER MOLLY
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND
THAT'S THE GRANDFATHER
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S HOPE
THEY WERE ALL WHITE
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
I THINK WE WANT THE
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND HAVE DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE'S A TECHNOLOGY CAR
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE ABOUT OURSELVES ACTUALLY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST OF THE MONEY WOULD SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIT THEIR EDUCATION
IT'S SO NO BLOCKAGES
BUT THIS WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TWO MEN AND WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A 10 YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRAQ IN AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORLD
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM AT THE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN CALL IT AWAY
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY KIDS WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAY ACTIVITIES
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST GET HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MAS
I KNOW WHAT IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY OUTCOME
THEY HAVE BEEN SOUGHT BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN DO WEALTHY ARAB STORIES
THIS IS JUST ONE INVASIVE A BOOMING SATURATE ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE AEROPATION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONVERSATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE ARE THE MILLIONS OF WAYS TO EAT MEATS
IF WE'RE 400 WE MIGHT HAVE MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
IT'S A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IT'S MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON SOMETHING STORY THAT
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE THAT
COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLOP ORGANIZATION
THEY DO POLLS RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO GETS BORED
SO LIKE THE LEAVING WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP YELLS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN
THERE WERE NO ROADMAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I GO
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE A TRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I WAS LIKE WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PREDICT WORDS BECAUSE THE WASHINGTON DRUG ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
AS A CHORAL MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROBABLE TIP
YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD SPEECH
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBERS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST GET BUSINESSES COMPLETE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND GET TO THE RIGHT SIDE TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD ALL VIRTUAL PARTIES
THEY NEED THE BOARD
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING ORIGIN
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT AMAZING
THEY FEEL HOME
