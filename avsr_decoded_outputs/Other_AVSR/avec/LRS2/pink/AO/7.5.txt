and for me the surprise was
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next day
when there isn't much else in
the second half of october
well inter knowke them
we can just about get away with it now
something like a garden compost
it's not all about s's
and if you're wonderful
starting with the compasxst
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
please don it now
don't forget me
these are my words
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the blueprint
you we was so popular
instead of being someone's onm ctei
i expect you to have the past
see how much it comes to
i paid the money
over the causerse of his life
when it's finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any man would be proud to have view as a son
at the end of the die
get them into the garden
this one is totally out of control
but it comes and goes
it's part of that gr spees
i think it's brilliant
a one bedroomed first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm not massively happy
if you are looking around auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what is surprise when you come in
because if it's fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not as easy as it looks
stick to what you're goingd at
that is important
but he did really well
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
i couldn't read it
except as a last resort
you never know by the end of the bill
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some members of the public don't quite understand leisehold
if you lived in the building
would you want neighbour every week or every fortnight
but i think he's already learnt some really important property lessons
choosing a good location
you have to hold your nerve
who's very much into family history
we don't want to spend more than
it deertinitely won't be
i think something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm wriiting bay that
time has passed
so let's go back and find out
very impressed
the best bargains
not quite as high
it's a plus point
on the face of it
the first and second fouror flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give it a try
go to the press
learning the ropes
hi feet tall
and the reason for that
a little saxifa
wherever you are
it may be a miniature compared to that
i can plant them in that spot
sometimes he doesn't
i think it looks great
that's quite a large leaf
and it's a great way to eat it
that first meeting
but now we have these viruses
spirl pox spyus
causes it no harm
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is the town of two cities
it's a long way from home
as you enter the rear part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm still happy
you must have a personal key
we will own it together
it will be a great investment
or properties should i say
pretty on the outside
because it was offices
very close by the university
ground floor flat
i would market that
addam another ten on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartments around here at the moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
realistic value wise
she was a floodship
even befo she entered the water
visigiting almost all parts of the empire
from small ships
is it true she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you intend to bid on the place
it's hard to come away from it
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroying the property
purely by chance
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
he was my builder
we put in a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic book villain
and then of course
desperate to prove your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the prevailing wins
searching for answers
we know what they are
there's no obvious reason
taking horticulture to the extreme
the whole gardens are extraordinary and
like hundreds of thousands of people do every year
but now there's more protection
about 20 years ago
and a couple of weeks ago
enjoy the summer
are they relatives of yours
not just a hotel
but the ward off the story
they would be able to go back
not just a hotel
not just in this town
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his vantage point
there is no air so there is no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only 1en minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new build property should mean you don't have any work to
some issues with potential damp
great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just relying on this information
all of the brains combining all the different senses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open plant area is definitely the way to go
travel three miles for the west and you do get more for your money here
if that was fitted out
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be a above path
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
things like that we'll do ourselves
this auction lot had it in spaine
if you can't go up
its cosmetically improved quite drastically here
on the second floor
it's very clean
the appliances have been done nicely
it could be your passport for a small fortune
other words made the base
garage and technoal funk
love not them much
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spring
over the last two weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel the world
here in this greenhouse and the other one
as long as your carm
is it all good news
why are many supermarkets stopping selling caged eggs
free range goods
to make it work
very few remains
taking it all in
one northn welsh grewler
for the first time
formly acknledged this title as the prince of wales
and here on top of the eagle tower
which is n in svia
according to legend
it was a blank canvas
the first y werenow
as she layed dying
the garrison responded with a hail of arrows
and when you're moving through enemy territory
the garrison tried to surrender before he could try out his new toy
he ordered them back inside
you don't deserve m grace
taking no chance this
tearing it to the ground
according to legends
there was a portk colours
people sat on the stairs
which is ideal for it
cracks will appear
someone came out of neighbouring property and said
very expensive shed
without my sun gasset
even the forepla
and then when it came to his signature
it's a backing show
she's pushed herself
it sounds wrong
what have you learned
children and adults are like
that's a shocking percentage
i'm just hopeful
we have a lot less atmosphere above us
no longer would measurement be based on the human body
no longer dependent on the sun
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks for watching
our continued pressure
an inflammatory photograph
inflammatory or terrible images
we have to look at house vaudi arabia
in terms of britain
to the average person
there's a fair chance you will be
about 2 million
when it comes to the issue of people marriage
to allow bad surveillance to whher on the vine
if you don't like the slowgan
you have a problem with it
in all seriousness
but it has established the infrastructure of a police state and it could be open to abuse in the
i have nothing to hide
gure street lighting can help
the next generation
i'm not jeremy vine
standing in for your regular host for one week on llyak
and what a privilege that is
if you're watching
that's all for this week
but you agree
across 95 miles
their floating hotels
but before that
i can't believe it
in a form of a dessert plate
regarding one of britain's most noted
that makes a grand total of six
in a modern house
without further redo
the perfect pighte
anything could happen
they're all about the same
we have run out of time
louise and kevin
now they are gathering
all liight in the arctic
could we arrange that
i was fine yesterday
let's not mess about
what i can tell you
this is south wealth
the romans felt their presence was strong enough here
to say to the king
when he was staying in palace
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
literally two minutes from the airport
maybe more of steill an i
which melts more ice
think about the melting sea ice
again open to the elements
very attractive young woman
and that had an important effect
provided by the railways
the great thing about the railways is
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
there is one thing
it might be on fun item
of course it look
today's contestants are
thanks for watching
i feel guilty when i'm at home
i will always need you
thank you very much
as you might say
but my goodness
also known as a tndantam
so i think it is a piece of very one dimensional left wing propaganda
there is a huge cross over between the two
tax credits are basically benefits
formerly knowamn as simon
i feel like this
because that's how you' are a part of society
before i came out
or more correctly councils
especially as it relates to children
they are children
i do hope you'll join us then
it's long an allows p living me
if you haven't caught it yet
herself currently learning to time
some people here tonight prefer subtitles
surely as a matter of principle
if you're watching
standard weiates of might
heas a tight blow
in the meantime
when my husband and i are not arow
asking for permission
and it was totally normal
that sounds like a pretty crezy job for anyone to be doing
all my fingers were hanging off
i went to use my right arm
he was shot and killed
if i didn't have her
but at the same time
i'm with mark twain lies a
it's the internet
and i'm wn
in the basement
they haven't gone father
time now for one of the greatest tv comomebacks of ourart time
harolds in neighbours
we need to start layering
one is the pilot
surrender was not an option
many were teenagers about to get their first taste of war
i'm ky sorry
he died that very first day
this is one of the questions
celebrating 100 years of war films and
where i'm going
but en0 years ago
it could end tonight
back in theierra leone
and this wasn't unusual
as well as the body
giving hope and care to others is something our armed forcies do without question
we heard the story of the nurse and across
to have no contact at all
she needs to make sure that
they don't call them team pocket rocket for nothing
you've probably got yours
and the weather has been perfect
courage under fire
most of his life
this is the nord ash croft gallery
trapped under heavy artillery vironment
ken days beforehand
the president alk haas met with pregant obama
mr trum takes office in january
today they talked about the process of transition
we have all the usual suspects
anywhere in the world
demonstrates the value of green space
sort of ten cubic metres
i just collapse
as we approach for remembrance sunday
i've been involved with the military
the armed horces
that knock on the door is a moment they will never forget
who was killed in afghanistan
on a routine visit to an iraqi police station
killing him and five friends
it won't take h h
so what is the etiquette
which is a shame
between them now
i have had my fitting now
mr kh' speaking
if we have learned one thing over the past year
i don't really want to go
prising above it
the olympics swimmer
i wish i was more like you
why don't we all just get along
a trival nation
which upset some of our female resvidence
thanks for watching
quarter rercon style
it was really nice
you won't have long
on this remembrance weekend
an opportunity to paytribute to all members of the armed forces
if you've got it
we would love to sell it
we would love to see you
only seven places remained
like many others
great lenonard coenin
i love weddings
i've got a better idea
why don't we all object
that was amazing
it was an incredible performance
it was incredible entertainment
up until last week
the man takes the lead
it's time now for everything in between
i really appreciate it
it is all based on this 58 page report prepared for the european commission
but when you look inside
they get moost on the way home
and you've got every right to bee
having said that
that was fast and furious
done and dusty
that's not an ancient roman mark
these japanese made
which a lot of them were
our'll joumey is the mdi yet
and it's not just any on tuesday it
who knew that one man
it might be too late by that
don't think so
from what we know
thank you very much
graham barrn ash
and they were the first people
earlier this month
he was brilliant
furniture objects like that
it was made in germany
no one will look twice
and i'm pretty sure his pushbike came in very handy
they were so inspired by it
check the details on our website
ln as much as possible
keep going on about this
i do nothing wrong
you see what do you think
this is where the surprise is happened
it's time to return to wolth haampton
they decided to tie the knot
everywhere you go around here
we have some unfinished business to do in the auction room
we have gone difficult
and after reaching out to him on the show
run for cover if you can
they are under a lot of stress
with that in mind
welcome to the tower
was it your choice
you really feel the part of this
it's so wonderful to see that
talking about this
for me it doesn't make sense
if we have a delif in reinternation
even though her father at that time disagreed
so when the body have brought back
my first granddalder
nonviolent offensive
there are a lot of people
around the world
but i can across training prisons
so look at the cost of this failure
and the average cost of keeping the person in prisonent is 36
the most famous of them all have to be the works of the bronte sisters and
in terms of fire service resources
rather than using drugs
that's good news
the big question is
have you ordered yours yes
but these are one of the most wary birds in the world
that's not what i was expecting at all
i love sediables
and you know what this means
we might find some baritime memorabilia
it's a wonderful
stocks and shares
and in the process of me not offending god
i don't care what the cost is
because the whole point of 9 11 is that it's the justification for the police state
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've heard
and it is all about the context
child at the millennium
two appointments later
the man cares about animals
guess what i'm talking about ri now
pre to give us a rundown of the greatest facial choreograhy ever seen on the box
things to really tell the story
get yourself over here because first up tonight
if you want to know what the kids are listening to these days
louise and kevin
and it's the one that
that was beautiful
on international women's day
and went on an ordinary wing
the duke of blocter
and you know that
we had the delectable meal jones
but don't worry
that was some time ago
real friends that care about me
clearly they do
you don't need it
the reason being
the president chair
not to think themselves
that is a first
with my blessing
that's the message from independent economists after the chancellor' autumn statements
and with that in mind
his father died
not just here in nottingamshure
but it seems dependence as to everyone's personal taste
it's time to find out if iidgel
remember that man with the camera
and you can follow us
thanks for watching
but it's not doord bags
i do know what it means
when i found out
after all i've been through
i want to talk about daddy too
everybody was blown away
we still have all of its to come
i want to take a selfie
rescuing a dam full in distress
all of thatould change
but what exactly is it
how does it work
there's always historical treasures to look at
fast and furious
and later in turn
later on in like
he moved around a lot
as it's the title of this poem
four kilometres without even really thinking about it
in the highway code itself
so in the meantime
through antibody crected therapy
and i feel very
i'm your simon toweel
for some reason
i just can't seem to win
it will be a brilliant success
who retreat the pla
i'm struggling with that one
here's a latin sensation
born into a family of dancers
i made a few calls
as well as the green man
this is extremely rare and valuable
not a subject at
my hasten to add
here on the day
but i felt he was exposed
you and him
will appear in court next month
and the champagne
before we bring on our next contender
if you've got a question for either of themy
so to do ballroom
i am the ultimate power
it is the quarter finals
we had a bealazingray
when he retired
the familys seat
please welcome jenni aclare
it's a movie theme
they have no idea or to expect
two and a half minutes to that round
so let's get on it
thanks for watching
i'm not satisfied
it's on our table package
when we see him
you want me to be happy
what season was that
no bood left out
on you a 4
probably in the world
i'm really looking forward to this
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiplarians
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand one of these monuments in a modern
and people live in
it's about the deay
a purification so many
it's so much an old person
and this might think
every single presd
that's the best kind of teaching
i had a great time
that's what childsport services does
nickola is definitely the love of my life
sheh is my juliet
it was shoutter my marin
i guess i'm afraid
i like spending time with him
and it is a service
she's got to the best top line in the business
so i don't know
that's what you said
it is just a name
i've been wxed
talk about about smart
my little boy is
that seems to me like a pretty impressive perk of the job by anybody's standards
we bought the firm back
enjoy the money
embossed leather wallpaper
i'm getting older
i'll be popping in e evening
join me tomorrow
but she's not confused
you need to be stronger here
make sure you never get a depressed again
with billing not be an yours
when it comes to designing fabulous costumes
theyre buffling to be groundned pro challengeed champions
the prime minister snappedim down
how big is that
separated from that
coming in on the other side
what did you put in a mild wine
it's a terrible idea
and they don't make big money
everywhere you look
you really make my day
and we have today
men will to be him
he absolutely insisted on writing his own intro
family and friends
it's all about the strictly prot challenge
but before we can go any further
the six highest scoring runners up will qualify
thanks for watching
just before christmas
that's it for the reds
i think she's completely bonkererss
you are dynamic
it was full of content
adlyin would saying
it's actually a sulser
the garden of england
you can get a better structure
every year since christmas began
way back in the early
i actually wanted to be horse
usually ampoicible
through the accessibility to those children
like most other forms of modern warfare
you do love your dog
they were innocent and charming
you want to look
or is that you enjoy those toys and it makes seem to a different person
space was still the final frontier
it looks really like it is
when i get home
the ball shaped one
you see that present
so what he did to get round thatre
but in those days
it comes fire engine
four little turtles named after italian renaissance artists
some burned brightly for a year or two
you didn't have one
what was all that about
already in the states
the right place
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
sausages in bacon
christmas pudding that nobody really likes
stick some james bond on
that someone was going to get
she can't really say
goot in front of the whole family
you unfold the board
at the same time
in victorian britain
on the orders of queen victoria
i think is perfect
when it comes to toys
maybe not uranian
but i like to see it
we like to themm a nice
for that reason
this really makes us thingk
maybe there's an extensive pattern
when the archaologists got to work
and tried not to get carried away
it really was that bad
they they will not do
let's take a look behind the scenes how it all came
time out for our next buest
over the last 12 years
why show me this
i' on the case
even christmas day
but towards the end
he has not held back anything
but it was so disconcertinly calm in the studio
here to reveal the secret to getting your hands on the trophy
i shouldn't say those things
what else can i be
not well dressed
she is married now
best than happiest of ootat
the time before him was his own
that's what i am
it sounds very good
she's depressed about daddy
you listened to me
i'm still surrounded by hundreds of people
all the information will be there
every week he comes out
the rivalry in or that
to leave back to me
but for all that
i'd like to help you
i don't want to be soming
which is incredible
i had no idea how much
but at the same time
so let's find out who that will eat
some decent scores
thanks for watching
the perfect house
the perfect family
and as a result
the first muslim woman to serve the cabinet minister
it's not the middle ages
he doesn't own me
so please welcome
it was actually extremely well placed
leas don't try to vote if you're watching on demind
attention and emotion
and it is perfect for tonight
can they improve on that sport and possibly run away with trophy
that was within fuget
for the audience at home
the rise of mad
proper street food is great
you don't have to be a celebrity
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
if you can have sex
take us for the match
it's not curiy
thanks for watching
fame and fortune
i'm not afraid of being challenged
there's no wrong way
and you can follow us on twitter
thanks for watching
in this case a flowrer
as animals are preparing for the winter
but there's a problem
cheap and steal from one another to get themselves a decent meill
it seemed to be
i do miss a little bit
this is all you
before you know it
youd go to bed with it
and your family and your kids and your other jobs
that was amazing
the long you day in
because you work so hard
if you go wrong
go about telling him that
for good reasons and bad reasons
if they start from here
iobsessed with the show
i had prine wiayght
if we have a litt at argument
so when he gets graumpy it's like
let's he jumple
i'm sure you can imagine
she is histsterical
when i was a kid
very high level
going all over the world
people are happy to be there and it's a good fiive
everywhere you turn
because they've got to
just working with him every week it's such a treat
which was quite amusing
that's a pickle walnut
you have to go and buy biscuits
you wast your time
they all came and went
it didn't survive
so would be
right on the front
in this country
twice during the first world war
he never let on
so you know who he really is
so please welcome
this could be a first class routine
everyone on the show really
with white christmas
being my own
although i can't imagine why
because i just want to help
from their spaceit
project management is really my specialist area
to be completely honest
sheer size and power can be intimidating
but there was even better news
represented by this funch of bananas
it's down to while braying getting things wrong
he was about to find out
the forces of nature separate out
neutrons and electrons
but when you open the box
that's not right
in this universe
and it might seem ridiculous
12 miles in diameter
stretching back 3
staggering on the edge of space
pondering the immensea
we live in a tiny
thanks for watching
you think i did this
it's all about rarity
as opposed to chinlda
but i couldn't believe it would be true
you've got a good storin
and a man who made the discovery
but everyone goes into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellious socks
to get that scarecro
maybe to somewhere nice and safe
i'm not sure what's most difficulant thing to get right
gardens never finished
she never be pquit tough
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify rooms
there are times i like to listen to banana ama
and yet thatat and fish and chips
l's justalm down
the day just got weirder and weirder
back to the history books
it's practically a vegetarian
how does the plant attract the bat
the back benefits
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertisement which says
this is the best bat hotel in town
that's why i get up in the morning
two minutes on general knowledge
all in the glare is spot
so what did you do before
but you have to go
and she was being intervieed by the american journalists
he als he is ness
we did a different version of things
and then turned to me and said
i haven't thought that
that would be fantastic
p budgim ro bent
every two weeks
that's what they do
before we begin
and on this fateful evening
what's your name
i don't believe in fairies
then we must rescue her
and with stol
he made a movei on me
we'veen disgust it
and we ran love
how do i choose this
we've got 24 characters
following those words
i think you deserve
a striking contrast
very similar to fishing
it's like looking at art
it might be conceptual
thanks for watching
here's some ideas
a place which is hard to live
and the farmers opening a touch
so when the farmers come
there's more woodland
don't tell anyone
we have no more money
we are the criminals
no more suicide bombers
that's according to the police watchdog
the queen mary and the queen elizabeth
it's design values
they were in the minority
500 tons of ocean 9
one of the articles here is about the queen elizabeth
the job was done
thanks for watching
flowers and eaten vegiables
to be something completely different
when it comes to publicity
how great this
i just love that
they were friends
tell me about it
until next time
to be a successful entrepreneur
i just don't get it
and i think this is one
something like that
with corrupt governments
because of the small size
it wll be more matches
and more money for future
pleased with himself
serviet is panemonium let loose
there are no recordings of lloyd george at the peak of his palace
which was the mass newspaper
and he w very devoted to his children
and would eventually married her after his wife
the that flourish
what you need to do is get the very best frames
the very fveryst talents
the most energetic people in
because the empire
it's often forgotten
which is absolutely understandable
you hope to return to power
would not be a happy place
depended on trade
my great great grandfather
much more driven
if it gives me some sort of control back
it's gun wins
i don't remember that happening before
by some miracle
that's very good
comes from one of the most beautiful parts of the world
it's not a mass sum of money
they love architecture
rking up on the
i wouldn't say i'm a star
man intereester not fs
thanks for watching
set up by the government
it was a brutal experience
many people did slipping for and very eaay
they kept fleaeling
and in the morning
it exact
and the second generation
been intensely sad
and all the survives at the holocaust
with their data base
get a new loyal customer and debonanon's
as long as they see the spark of success
there was a stone circle here
during the summer months
that is a sold sound
there's plenty to indulge in
she was struggling
when he went to look for her
whatever it wasst
25 years to complete
she will be very pleased
because there was no role model
one male official commented
but despite all this
they carried on competing
but despite all this
if you want to experience some of that
you're wasting your time
including a baby
this is a semifinal
i'm sorry that doesn't meet with your approval
i'm not having a go at youre
i'm just saying that dinne's brought me up
we had no money
