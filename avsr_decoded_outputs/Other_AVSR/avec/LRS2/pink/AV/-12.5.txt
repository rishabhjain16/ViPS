don't forget me
things in my words
it would have been completely cal to the rest of lond
but i think what was of the blue bit
popular
instead of it was comm
i expect to have a
cmaome
i pay the money
the course of his love
when you finished
but before i do
this house would come together and fourished
any man will be proud to have done

im mr garden

ik it's brien
what better first flor flat
if you're going to be increased
it's sid
i'm notpassively happy
if you are looking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive gide price for subotential house so well
done on time and the right money
but what's surprised when you come in
it's fantastic
what do you think about that
look
it's not eas it looks
what you at
that is important
it's really well
i knew what i used to do what i was the boy
i'm start i'mfa nparment
i couldn't wait
except lundred
you never know by the end of the bid
i know it comes with planning permission
but we improve on a green roof
we've got a graate relationship
whatere is the k
somembers the public don't understand'oold
if you left in the building
new name is everywhere every night
but i think it's really really important property listons
good oion

who's f prarticul family history
i we spnd more
dead it won't be
thin there' something dressing needs to be done
what do you rp aboutck
i'm reriting to say that
as best
so let's go back and find out
very impressed

on the face of it
the first floor flats
as you recid of smoking
we'll give it a try
go the bit
the grops
eight fe tall

a little sen frst
what wherever you are

is't that simple
that's really deouf d
it's a long way from home
and you e rare part ofo
lots of thingeds to think about
i'm so happy
who must have a personal
we were looking together
it would be a great investment
or property to say
bring it on the outside
because it was offic
very close by the university
grandfather flat
i would market that
this day on
this property
but in this case
one medroom apartment and there at a moment
probably around 55
and she's the converiction
really value work
she was a flor trip
given him a forehand to the water
visiting on which all part of the impact
from small chips
t she would
sometimes it's difficult where
if you were to blo pla
i'll be wareing for me
it's very good lit
it's different amount of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of cocan
what was it man you think
i would do that
destroy the property
