and for me the surprise
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next day
whether there isn't much else in the garden
so you've seen half october
well into november
we can just about get away with it now
it seeming like a garden compost
it's not all about stars
and if you want wonderful
starting with the compost
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
please donate now
don't forget me
things are my words
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the blue piece
he was so popular
instead of being someone's arm kenty
i expect you to have a post
see how much it comes to
i pay the money
livter the causese of his life
when it finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any man will be proud to haveview as a son
at the end of the time
get them into the garden
this one iss totally out of control
but it comes and gost
it's part of the natural garden scheme
i think he's brillant
a one bedroom first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm not massively happy
if you are looking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what is surprise when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not as easy as it looks
stick to what you're good at
that is important
but it did really well
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up a venue for youang holiday makers on an island at bahamas
i couldn't read it
except at last resort
you never know by the end of the bills
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like de green roof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some members the public don't quite understand leasehold
if you lift in the building
would you want new nigh is every wehere or every fortnight
but i think he's already learned some really important property lessons
using the good locations
you have to hold your nerve
who's very much into family history
we don't really spend more than
it definitely won't be
i think something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm writing to say that
time has passed
so let's go back and find out
i'm very impressed
the best bar is
not quite as high
it's a blus point
on the face of it
the first and second floor flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give it a try
go to the bred
learning the ropes
eight feet tall
and the reason for that
a little seaxon for us
wherever you are
it may be a military compared to that
i can plant them in that spot
sometimes it doesn't
i think it looks riat
it hass quite a large leaf
and it's a great way to eat it
that first meeting
but no we have these viruses
squirrelox fius
cousou it your harm
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is tll of two cities
it's a long way from home
and you enterd the rare part of the shop
lots of thingse think about
i'm still happy
who must have a personal key
we were all onn it together
it will be a great investment
or properties should i say
pretty on the outside
because it those offices
very close by the university
ground floor flat
i would market that
add another tad on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment around there at a moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
realistic value wise
she was a flow shrip
even before she entered the water
visiting almost all parts of the empire
from small ships
as a tooh she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you intend to be on a place
it's started to come away from this
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroying the property
purely by chances
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
he is my builder
we played a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic book villain
and then of course
desperate to prorove your bizarre sera
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the prevailing wins
searching frances
we know what they are
there's no abvious reason
taking horticulture to the eat free
the whole gardens are extraordinary hands
like hundreds of thousands of people do e
but now there's more potential
about 20 years ago
a couple of weeks ago
enjoy the summer
are their relatives of yours
not just that whose help
but the wld of the flo that
they will be able to go back
not s your su who's help
let just to this town
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his fastest point
there was nohere so there was no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new build property should mean you don't have any work to
some issues with potential damp
a great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than to rely on this information
all the brain is combining all the different senses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open pan area is definitely the way to go
travel three miles farth the west and you do get more f yourw money here
if that was fitted down
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be a above par
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
things like that we'll do ourselves
this auction lot has it in spain
if you can't go up
it's cosmatically improved quite drastically
on the second floor
it's very clean
the applaces have been done nicely
it could be your passport to a small fortune
anoter words made the base
garage and techn of funk
and not novemma
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spring
over the last tw weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel the world
here in this greenhouse and the other world
as long as your calm
is it all good news
why are many supermarkets stopping selling calndegs
free veg cures

one northn welsh ruda
for the first time
formerly acknowledged this title as the prince of wales
and here on top of the eagles tower
which is how acadia
according to legends
there was a blank canvas
in the first year alone
and she lay died
the garrison responded with a hail of arrows
and when you're moving through any meatav a trey
the garrison tried to surrend it before he could try out his new toy
he ordered them back inside
you don't deserve my grat
taking no chances
tearing it into the ground
according and legends
there was a port colours
people sat on their stairs
which is an idea for it
cracks will appear
someone came out of neighbouring property said
very expensive shit
without my son lessons
even the foreplay
and then when it came to his signature
it's a baking show
she's pushed herself
it sous wrong
what have you learnted
children and adults like
that's a shocking percentage
i'm just hopeful
we have a lot of less atmosphere bove us
no longer would measurement be based on the human bolety
they're longer dependent on the sun
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks to watching
our continued pressure
an inflammatory photograph
inflammatory or terrible images
we have to look at how saudi arabia

what i can tell you
this is south well
the romans felt that their presence was strong enough here
to say in
when he was a sty at the palace
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain
literally two minutes from the airport
maybe more off still and
which melts more ice
think about the melting sea ice
again open to the elements
very attractive young woman
and that has an important effect
provided by the railways
the great thing about the railways is
everyone arrives at the same place at the same time
there is one thing

thanks for watching
i feel guilty when i'm at home

because that's how you are a positive society
before i came out
or more threly councils

celebrating 100 years of war films
where i'm going
but ten years ago
it could end tonight

and this wasn't unusual
as well as a body

great let a coin
i love weddings

why don't we all ob checked
that was amazing
it was an incredible puffformance
it was incredible entertainment
up unt the last week
the man takes the lead
it's time now for everything in between
i really appreciate it
it's all based on this 58 page report prepared for the european commission
but when you look inside
they get lost in the way at home
and you got every right and b

welcome to the tower
within your choice

so wonderful to see that

for me it doesn't make that
if we have a belief in reincalnation
even though her father at that time disagree
so when the body is brought back
my first granddlder
nonviolent aventes
there are a lot of people
around the world
but i come across training prisons town
i' looked at the cost of this failure
the average cost of keeping a person in prison is 36
the most famous of them all have to be the works for bronte sisters
in terms of fire service resources
rather than using trucks
that's good news
the big question is
a view hold that doors yet
but these are one of the most rarey birds in the world
that's not what i was expecting at all
i love see aning mo
and you know what this means
we might find some maritime memorabilia
it's a wonderful
stocks and shares
and in the process of being not offending god
i don't care what the cost is
because the whole point of 9 11 is that it's the justification for the police state
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've had
and it's all about the context
charles for millannia
to appointments later
the man who cares about animals

that is our first
with my blessing
that's the message from independentce economists after the trancelists autumn statements
and with that in mind
his father died
not just clearing notcking i'm sure
but it seems dependent to to everyone's personal tass
it's time to find out if nationl
remember that man with the campera
and you can follow us
thanks for watching
but it's not all bankws
i do know what it means
when i found out
after all i've been through
i want to talk about attitude
everybody was blown away
we still have all of this to come
i want to take a selfie
rescuing a damse sell in distress
all of that can change
but what exactly is it
how does it work
there's always historical treasures to look at
fast and furious
c later return
later in life
they moved around a lot
as is the title of this poem
four kilometreers without even really thinking about it
in the highway code itself
so in the meantime
through antibody directed therapies

he retrieved the flag

what season was that
no food left out
i met you at the poxy

i'm really looking forward to this
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiquaries
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand what of these monuments in a modern
and people' liveing
it's about the days
a purification ceremby
it's a much a lot of person
and this might be
every single person
that's the best kind of teaching
i had a great time
that's what chanld support services does
nicolar is definitely  love of my life
she's mychul heet

it's actually a sulsa
the garden of england
you can get a better structure
every year since christmas began
wayed back in the early
i actually wanted to be cs
usually a bicycle
through the accessibility to those children
like most other forms of modern warfare
you do love your doull
they were innocent and charming
you want to look
or is it that you enjoy those toys and makes you into a different person
space was still the final frontier
it looks really like it is
when i get home
the ball shamed one
you see that present
so what you did to get round thatn
but in those days
it becomes a fire engine
four little titles named after italian renaissance arcists
some' burn brightly for a year or two

already in the states
the right place
nothing wrong with that idea in principle
sausages in bacon
christmas pudding that nobody really likes
stick and james bond on
that someone was going to get

not in front of the whole family
you unfold the board
at the same time
in victorian britain
on the ordersce of queen victoria
i think he is perfect
when it comes to toys
maybe not the uranium
but i like to seek it
we liked it rubbin years
for that reason
this really makes this thing
maybe there's an extensive pack
when the acheogy got to work
i'm trying not to get carried away

the let' faces
project management is really my specialist area
she'd been completely honest
the sheer sars and power can be intimidating
but there was even better news
represented by this bunch of bananas
it's down to wild brain and getting things wrong
he was about to find out
the forces of nature separate out
neutrons and electrons
but when you open the box
that's not right
in this universe
and it might seem ridiculous
12 miles in dimets
srathing back 3
staggering on the edge of space
pondering the immense
we live in a tiny
thanks for watching
you think i did this
it's all about rarity
as opposed to chinese
but i could't beieve it would be true
if you've got good stoy
and a man who made the discovered
but everyone going into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellous socks
don't forget that scarecrow
maybe somewhere nice and safe
i'm not sure what's most of you things get right
gardens never finished
you sh'll never be put off
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify rons
there are times i like testan pananrama
and yet that and fish and chips
this isasalm down
that i just got weirder and weirder
back to the history books
it's practically a vegetarian
how does the plant attract the b
the batck benefits
it's also come up with a structure that acts as an advertment which says
this is the best bat hotel in town
that's why i get up in the morning
two minutes on general knowledge

so why did you do before

until next time
to be a successful entrepreneur
i just don't get it
and i think this is one
something like that
with erupt governments
because of the small size
it can mean more matches
and more money for favour
pleased with himself
servia is pandemonium let loose
there are no recordings of lloyd george at the peak of his powers
which was the mass newspaper
and he was very diviculing to his children
and would ementually marry her after his wife
without flourish
what you need to do is get the very best brains
the very best chalenge
the most intjectic people in
because the empire
it's often forgotten
which is absolutely understandable
he hoped to return to power
would not be a happy place
dependent on trade
my great great grandfather
much more terrific
if it gives me some sort of control back
which non wins
i don't remember that happening before
by some miracle

and all the survives the hol court
with their day space
get a new loyal customer and depenams
as long as i see the spark of success
from the school so cqueer
during the summer months
that is a sold sound we
there's plenty to indulgeent
she was struggling
when he went to look for her
whenever it was
25 years to complete
she will be very pleased
because there was ro of
one male official commedy
but despite all this
they carried on competing
but despite all this
if you want to experience some of that
you're wasteing your time

i honestly don't thin know what to do
and i do mean hundreds
i don't mind this one
and just between you and me
judging by what i saw today
some got what they want

have you got it
but i promise you
you better stay well away from me
that i'll be ok
thousands of pounds
we ne do something bigger
trying to bring them down over the centuries
but you don't need to worry
the experts don't know what cls did
father died five years ago
things like that
it's all about myth making
comome to my room
as the morning spread upon the mountains
with people without creating
when other people
can the initial stand for the international marksist group
as you may know
this came from the bach
i probably would
goo that that's really sad
i need to get talk
before i announceed the winner
we need to find out is there a problem
we don't have brown bear
if ncers knowo
we may enjoy the thrill of more regular sightings
what can aspirations
without the stying law
very heavily ss
and the sudish customers to buy
and it was built to accuby public subcception
today almost 50
the government looks set to win
which the norwegian government was supporting
a rather special
you should think about it
good luck with that
we found out about the suffold bunch horses
but it's a different type of animal i want to show you right
things like this became very
the quality of that sliding across
that's what it's all about
join us next time for many more surprises
goes that the other
we don't slip it for the money
i don't really mind
a new chance of life
but i'm not sure where
it's higher than before
but another strike in union
there was a glimouk of hoppe
more open minded perhaps
and more open to the parliament
to revivee the room ino two parts
then eat invitation
he was halfway there
partw as the declaration of rights
they say that that the king may not raise taxation without the consent of parliament
it was the battle of the porn
i love the same
it makes them sound like an action film
which of course
the shar of mustard
it's here to stay
you've had a tough day
i think he will
really happy
so at one point
we do nothing about making cheese
and i suppose the bottom liners if you want a thriving
put it that way in
costing nearly 1 million
and getting rid of it
thanks for watching
at the top end of 15 to 18
once those lift doors open
to the potential investor
just like my personality
i know it quite well
and for that reason
i want to be in the holding company
i'm really sorry
good luck to him on the elusive michael beckett in then new dragon partnership
whatever they decide to call a company
that's a ho we grail
if you build it
very fin and deep
it separates yorkshire from lincolnshire
hoping to make a fortune at auction
after having spent t10 years himself in exerle
in the eyes of some
a wading call marh
robel was falling back
she informed me
you're on need it
it's just a wee village
the fishing villages on the northeast coast
some you have to book
i would say probably about 25
it's still going up
with the price of gold
and it's a beautiful place well
doesn't mean to say that we get on with everybody
from time to time
he didn't want it
we both want to be here
i really missed the oother
regardless what happens
i've just got back
finding the right path is not always easy
there is so much on over the weekend
and on 1nd it 12
what's the best thing about the royal highlandle show
we want to know what you think

the wonderful discovery of wicches
and our experts
while we make our wedding the coastline
the maincur
there was a boy
human representations can be offensive to muslims
i would like to help
thanks for watching
in the long term
the gut would go
but he wouldn' listen
i don't think
the work was hard
not part of glory
the operation would c ah
out or whatever it was
i know how hard you want
i can't take much more of this
this is very important
we need to be team
to these anemies
to speed things up
you're all the same
whll we've been away
came up with the perfect name
it's an amazing place
but that's all changing
going under the hammer right now
i think rather bowers
if we don't like it
lestton is here to help you
something is going to work out for me
with climate change
that's a bigg attraction
very soon after taking off
anything can happen
let's go inside
that was exciting
most of the recovered pieces were lost
i'm absolutely in love with this
i don't think so
that was going to be my next assumption
and it's a strange
so it's an inspiration
where are the moreall dves
of the same proportion
it's become so fragmented
let's put those valuations to the test
he made the superstruction
we would love to see you
we still have hundreds of people waiting to see our experts
but i thought it was a bit depressing
would you be happy
and i went to museum in this linton
i need to close the restaurant
at the price of property
i can't put any planer on that
for the bst part
on the othering
which is relatively small by scottish standards
and i read cope
you are out of it
over the next few weeks
for whatever reason
it can be quite donnting
a revolution steking please
we worked together when we were starting out
i don't want to
it is a battle that needs to be fought
we were flabourgascing
the day is today lives of tennis
and such a miniture responsibility
when you're away from it
the job script and of the farmers' waves
thanks for watching
a very popular tourist destination
mot of any gouff for any street
but' ready to go reason
what do you think
which is plains it
some 200 years later
this whole area will still be insafeestcts
everyone has gone home happy and that's what it's all about
and keep me like
this is my reventge
and it may well be
there aren't any biscuits in that all
i didn't meet you
that would just make things worse
what my father died
for the next two minutes
the way to market is
the ren leader of the gunpowder plot
all hoping the key would for
these lords would remain in place for over 200 years
as a result of the compound plot
it may take some time
you know most of itel
so i'll ask you again
