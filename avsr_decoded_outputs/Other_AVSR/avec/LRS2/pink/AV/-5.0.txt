and for me the surprise was
mov around
and we were fright
you're naturally
whether it's much elter in the garden
so you've seenough f october
whvember
we can just about get away with it now
i' citt garden compost
it's not all about
and if you want wonderful
it' starting with the compost
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i gock round
please donate now
don't forget me
things in my word
it would have been completely galia to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing inside of the blue prie
he was to popular
instead of being it was common ender
i expect to have a polis
see howmarch it comes through
i payid the money
after the course of his life
when you finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any man will be proud to i have us as the son
at the end of the day
getting me the garden
this one is totally out of control
it come to gohst
it's part of the natural garden scheme
i think it's brilliant
one bedroom first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent sidze
i'm not massively happier
if you are looking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
they're getting done on time and the right money
but what surprise when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's a lot easier it looks
stick to what you're loo at
that is important
but it's it really rall
and knew what i used to do when i was little boy
i'm starting up aventnding you for yang allol the mekan on an island at phartamas
i couldn't wait it
exccepted large resort
you never know by the end of the bids
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like a greroof
we've got great relationships
whatver is the guess
some members of the public don't quite understand thee old
if you lift in the building
you want new name is everywhere or every fur night
but i think it's really learn some really important property lessons
youid a good locations
you have to hold a youror turve
uss far mchino family history
but i would spend more
it decinely won't be
think is something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm writing to say that
time asas passed
so let's go back and find out
i'm very impressed
the best bart is
not quite as high
it's the birst point
on the face of it
the first and second floor flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give a try
go to the best
in the rops
eight feet tall
and then reason for that
a little sense of fr us
whaterever you are
it may be a mitchic complaint to that
i appla him the next spot
sometimes it caner
i think it looks at right
that's quite a large leaf
and it's a great way to eat
that first meeting
but no we have these viruses
switle box fiers
cous your am
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is dee of two cits
it's a long way from home
and you entered the rare part of the job
lots of need to think about
i'm just so happy
who must have a personal heke
we were looking together
it will be a great investment
or properties do i say
bring it on the outside
because there was offices
very close by the university
grand flator flatght
i would market that
and this tay on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment around there at a moment
probably around 95
and since the conversion
really is value work
she was a floor trip
even before she get to the water
visiting on which all parts of the impact
from small ships
as a su she was
sometimes it's difficult where
if youre sent to bel on a place
it's go you' be waiting for me
it seems a very good location
it's different amount of the market
it might be valable
that's my kind of location
what was it that the main you think
how can i do that
and destroying the property
purely by shar
are they struggling or are they infused with theistess
here's my builder
we plant a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any school comic boo filleand
and then of course
desperate to beute of your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the provailing wins

we know and what they are
there's no awfious reasons
taking horticulture to the east free
the whole gardens are extraordinary hand

before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multiicultource
on the face of it
buying a new build property should could have any work to
some issues with potential stamp
great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just relying on this information
all the brain is buying or different sences
who doesn't have fision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and certainly upstairs into an open ban area in deefine the way to go
travel three miles far the west and you do get more few money
if i were to fit itown
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be a above par
that's an option
that's very bad girs
