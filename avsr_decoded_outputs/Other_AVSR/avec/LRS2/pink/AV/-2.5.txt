and for me the surprise was
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next d thing you
whether it's much else in the garden
so you've seouond half october
what isvemember
we' can just about get away with it now
some the little garden compost
it's not all about star
and if you want wonderful
he started with the compost
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are go round
please join it now
don't forget me
things in my words
it would have been completely alalied to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the blue piece
he was so popular
instead of being someone's calmon canenteer
i expect to have a post
see how much it comes through
i' pay the money
itter the course of his life
when you finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any men will be proud to have use the son
at the end of the day
gett them intr the garden
this one is totally out control
it come you gost
it's part of the natural garden scheme
i think it's brioni
one bedroterom first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent sidze
i'm not massively happier
if you are looking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what is surprise when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
needs looking to sell it
it's not the easy as it looks
stick to what you could at
that is important
but it did really well
and do what i used to do what i was inittle boy
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
i couldn't read it
except large resort
you never know by the end of the bills
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
wherever is the gas
some members of the public don't quite understand lesehold
if you lift in the building
would you want new neighbors every wehere or every fhrnight
but i think he'sally learn some really important property lessons
using the good locations
you have to hold your nerve
who's very machinal family history
but i would spend more than
it exactly won't be
i think something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm writing to say that
time has passed
so let's go back and find out
i'm very impressed
the best partk is
not quite as high
it's the burst point
on the face of it
the first end second floor flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give a try
go to the best
none in the rooms
eight feet tall
and there reason for that
a little sexon for us
wherever you are
it may be a minhic com pla to that
i can plant him in the next pot
sometimes it doesnt
i think it looks a reat
that's quite a large leaf
and it's a great way to it
that first meeting
but no we have these viruses
switter box fiers
cour to your harm
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is the tal of two cities
it's a long way from home
and she enter the rare part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm so happy
who must have a personal key
we were lning together
it will be a crazy investment
or properties toould just say
putt it on the outside
because it was offices
very close by the university
grand flator flatght
i would market that
had a another tail on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment around there at a moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
realistic value wise
she was a floor trip
even before she entwer the water
visiting on which all parts of the impact
from small ships
as a trut she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you intend to beid on a place
it's start to come away from this
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroying the property
purely by shars
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
he is my builder
we played a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic boofilland
and then of course
desperate to move your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the prorevailing wins
searching frances
we know what they are
there's no obvious reason
taking horticulture to the east free
the whole gardens are extraordinary hand
like hundreds of thousands of people do whatever
now there's more potential
about 20 years ago
c and wks togher
enjoy the summer
are they relatives of yourws
not just like who help me
but the war of the for
they will be able to go back
not just that who's helping
i just in this town
emvery september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from its fastest point
there was no so there was no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multiculturuce
on the face of it
buying a new build property should mead you not have any work to
some issues with potential stamp
a great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just relying on this information
all the brain is combining all the different senses
who doesn't have fishing
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open ban area it's definitely the way to go
travel three miles farth the west and you do get more few money here
if that was fitted out
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be a above par
and that's an option
that's very bad nears
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
things like that will do ourselves
this auction lot at it in spadin
if you can't go up
it's cosmetically improved quite drastically he
on the second floor
it's very clean
the applaces have been done nicely
it could be your passport to a small fortune
other words made the base
the garage and tech on frunk
and not not every mu
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spring
over the last tew weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel the world

even the foreplay
and then when it came to his signature
it's a baking show
she's pushed herselves
it sounds right
wonderful loked

i'm just hopeful
we have a lot of blast atmosphere buffit
no longer would measurement be based on the human bodty
they'll all get dependentce on the sun
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks to watching
our continued pressure
an inflammishing photograph

so when the body is brought back
my first granddoda
nonviolent afentced
there are a lot of people
around the world
but i come across training prisoners town
i've look at the cost of it failure
the ovious cost of keeping a person in prison is c3 s6 n
the most famous from all have to be the works for bronte sisters
s to find service resulrces
rather than using truks
that's good news
the big question is
a youw hold the does yet
but these are one of the most rare birds in the world
that's not all i was expecting at all
i love se any morere
and you know what this means
we might find some maritime memorabilia
it's a wonderful
stocks and shares
and in the process of being not offending god
i don't care when the cost is
because the whole point of 9 11 in that its the justification for the police state
and i guess that's what's happening here
and from what i've had
and you' thought about the context
charles for malci

with my blessing
that's the mantic trp independent economists after the chancellor called h them mistabents

thanks for watching
put in not all backs
i do know what it means
when i found out
after all i've been through
i want to talk about the attitude
everybody was blown away
we still have all of these to come
i want to take a selfie
rescuing a damseelling distress
all of that can change
but what exactly is it
how does it work
there's always historic treasure to look at
fast and furious
colleator return
later in life
they moved around a lot
as is the title of this poem

what's season was that
no food left out

what in the world
i'm really looking forward to this
and it's even rarer to find one that hasn't been dug into by antiquaries
what we've got here is an opportunity to understand what of these bonuments and a modern
and people live in
it's about the days
a purification cerebly
it's a much a whole person

every single pers
that's the best kind of teaching
at a great time

nicolar is definitely enough of my life

the prime minister slaps him down
