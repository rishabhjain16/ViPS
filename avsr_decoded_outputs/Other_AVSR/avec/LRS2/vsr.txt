un for me the surprise was
they're moving around
and we were right
that's it
whether it is much older than the garden
so you've set a fotctome
well as november
we can just about get away with it now
some like garden compost
it's not all about size
and if you want wonderful
it's starting with the compost
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
but joning now
don't forget me
things in my world
it would have been completely alien to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the blueprint
it was so popular
instead of place that was st mending
i expected to have a part
see how much did comes to
i paid the money
after the course of his life
when i finished
but before i do
the house would just come together and flourish
any man will be proud to have you as a son
at the end of the day
getting me a garden
this were to c allowse to control
bling up the coats
it's part of the natural gardenscape
everything is broken
in what better in first floor flat
if you're going to be increased
but as a dec size
i'm not massively happy
if you are hiding around an auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
they get it done on time and for the right money
but what is the price when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not easy it looks
sic what you look at
that is important
but is it really well
i knew what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up a vscu for young holiday makers on an island in barhamas
i couldn't read it
accepted luy s
you never know by the end of the bill
i know it comes with planning permission
but we need to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
where it's the case
some members of the public don't understand its
if you left in the building
would you want new namees every week or every fo night
but i think it's really some really important property lessons
using a good location
you have to hold your nerve
who far magino family history
but i would spend more than
is that it won't be
i think something stressing needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm ready to say that
da's best
so let's go back and find out
very impressed
the best part is
not quite he
that's the pus point
on the face of it
the first ha to get four flats
as a start of smoking
we'll give it drink
don't the peas
in other groups
eight feet all
and the reason for that
a little ten of  us
wherever you are
it may be military compared to that
i can plant them with the i spot
sometimes in getas
i think it looks it right
it's quite large leaf
and it's a great way to eat
that first meeting
but now we have these viruses
to other pox virus
causeses your harm
but not for me as a farmer
it's that simple
this really is a s of t cities
it's a long a way from home
and you instid are part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm so happy
you must have a personal here
we were led together
it will be a great investment
or property just there
bring it on the outside
because it was obvious
very close by the university
ground floor flag
i would market that
has to learn this take on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment around at the moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
really is value quise
she was a flod trump
even before she on the water
visiting on which all parts of the empire
from small ships
as the true she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you a intend to bel on a plate
it's not come away from me
it's a very good location
but it's a different amount of the market
it might be valuable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how would i do that
and destroyed the property
the only bon charles
are they struggling or are they in flushed with
it is my opinion
we played a ba together
over just a coup of nights
just like any called comic bogrll
and then of course
desperate to prove your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the providing winds
searching for crushners
we know what they are
there's no obvious reason
taking older culture to the extore
the whole gardens are she of lands
like hundreds of thousands of people do
but now there's more potential
about 20 years ago
then a couple weeks ago
during the summer
are their relatives of yes
not just the hotell
but the wall of the story
they will be able to go back
not just cs help
i just in this
in september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his fastest point
there is no air so there is no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get so excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a malticulso
on the face of it
buying a new build property should mean it could have any work to
some issues with potential stamp
a great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just rely on thisubsmation
all of the brain is buying all the different senses
who doesn't have fish
so you have the bathroom in this area and then
when i say that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encounters problems
and certainly upstairs into an open bat area it definitely the way to go
travel three miles farer west and you do get more of money
if i was to fit it out
will it be fun
fabulous project for them
will it be above par
that's an option
that is very bad news
and that's really well done
this is hard work
things like that will want to ourselves
this auction lot has an in space
if you can't show up
it s dmatically improved quite drastically here
just like a four
it's for clive
the appliances have been done nicely
it could be your passport to a small fortune
thatet with this metal best
garry trying to take your fuck

because i must say
the following spring

and that's all about
i intend to natural british style
