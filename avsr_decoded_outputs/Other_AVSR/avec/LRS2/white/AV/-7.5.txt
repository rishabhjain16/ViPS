and for me the surprise
move around
and we were friend
you aaturally
whether it's much elter in the garden
so you've seaenough f october
when isvember
we're can just about get away with it now
i' the little gardi compass
it's not all about st
and if you are wonderful
it's starting with the compost
for the brief time
they will change lives
when my husband and i are kno round
please do it now
don't forget me
things in my words
it would have been completely ealiant to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing he inside of the blue pie
he was so popular
instead of being itn's common inda
i expect to have a part
cmm comes through
i paid the money
the course of his life
when finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourished
any man will be proud to have use the sone
ag end of the say
gett him me the garden
this one is totally out control
it become the ghost
it's part of the natal garden techame
i think it's brioni
one bedroom first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decon side
i'm not massively happy
if you are lking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
they get it done on time and the right money
but what' surprised when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
needs to looking at this sell it
it's not easy it looks
sick to what you're loo at
that is important
but it's really well
i knew what i used to do when i was initt boy
i'm starting up aventing you for yang holid the me on an island departament
i couldn't read it
excepted lundy tool
you never know by the end of the bids
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like a green roof
we've got a great relationship
why is the nest
some members of the public don't quit understand lhold
if you lift in the building
w you want new name is everywhere or every furnight
but i think it's really some really important property lessons
do in a good locations
you have to hold a youror durve
who's far machine to family history
i w spend more than
exactly it won't be
i think something drastic needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm writing to say that
tim' ass best
so let's go back and find out
very impressed
the best po is
not quite high
it's the birst point
on the face of it
the first andc floor flat
as a resid of smoking
we'll give a cry
goes to the pest
ler hrouope
eight feet tall
and the reallyon for that
a little test of fr us
wherever you are
it may be a michic com plans to that
i can pla them in the next spot
sometimes it caner
i think it looks it right
it's a quite a large lift
it's a great way to eat
that first meeting
but no we have these viruses
switl box fiers
cousse you am
but not for me to farming
it's that simple
this really is tl of tu sidit
it's a long way from home
and you entere the rare part of the sho
lots of needs to think about
i'm just so happy
who must have a personalkere
we were looking together
it would be a grez investment
or properties just say
bring it on the outside
because it was offices
very close by the university
grnd foret flat
i would market that
and you this tay on
f this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment around there at a moment
probably around 55
and she's the convertion
really value work
she was a floor trip
even before sh he inter the water
visiting on which all parts of the impact
from small chips
as a t she would
sometimes it's difficult where
if you intnd to be on a place
it's not' be way for me
it seems a very good new kition
but it a different amount of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that maad you think
how can i do that
and destroying the property
tuly by char
are they struggling or are they fusxed with the day
here is my builder
we plant a band together
after just a couple of days
any toood comic boo feld
and then of course you
desperate to but for your bizarre theory
but since jat's first discovery
protected from the provailing wins
searching trusthes
we know and what they are
there's no offuld reasons
taking horticulture to the east free
the whole gardens are extraordinary hand
like hundreds of thousands of people do whatever
now there's more potential
about 20 years ago
w to h
yous all the summer
are they relatives of fews
not just who's help
but the water of the flr
they will be able to go back
not just help
i just did this hou
every september this place would be transforming to what was
for over 700 years
so from his fastest point
there was no don there was no sound
with one of the rooms upset
which is only ten minutes away
this is sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multi contou
on the face of it
buying a new build property shouldmain youould' have any work to
some issues with potential stamp
great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than relying on this information
or the brain is buying all the different sces
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in thiscary and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and certainly upstairs into an open ban area in defoe the way to go
travel three miles far the waist and you do get more few money
if i were to fit down
will be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be a above par
that's an option
that is very bad nears
and that's really well done
this is hard work
med would't do ourselves
this auction lot has an in spain
