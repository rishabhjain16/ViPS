and and for me the surprise on was
they're moving around
and we were right
and the next day
there isn't much elseer than that
second half in october
and well into
i can just about get away with it now
something like a garden compost
not all about slse
and if you're wonderful
starting with the competition
for a brief time
it will change lives
when my husband and i are not around
please done it now
don't forget me
please are my wervous
it would have been completely aen to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here is kind of the blueprint
you was so popular
instead of being someone's arm cty
i expected you to have the past
see how much it comes to
i paid the money
for the course of his life
when it's finished
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any man would be proud to have vi youw as a suff
at the end of the time
get them into the garden
this one is totally out of control
but it comes and gooods
it's a partent gardens scheme
i think it's brilliant
a one bedroomed first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm not nans tobit happy
if you are looking around auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what a surprise when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's not as easy as it looks
stick to what you're good at
that is important
but he did really well
and do what i used to do when i was looking for
i'm starting up a venue for yank holiday makers on an island at bahamas
i couldn't read it
except as that last resort
you never know by the end of a build
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green broof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some of themers the public don't quite understand leisehold
if you lived on a building
would you want neibour every week or every philm aart
but i think he has already learned a really important property lessons
choosing a good location
you have to hold your nerve
who's very much into from history
we don't want to spend b than
it certainly won't be
i think something drastic it needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm writing say that
time has passed
so let's go back and find out
very impressive
the best bargains
not quite as high
it's a plus point
on the face ofim itt
the first hand second floor flats
as a resultless mentant
we'll give it a trouble
go to the prinon
mad in the rcks
hight feet tall
and the reason for that
a little saxon you me
whever you happen
it may be a miniature compared to g
i can plu them in that spot
sometimes you cashert
i think it looks great
that's quite a large leaf
it's a great way to t eat it
that first needed
but now we have these viruses
squirl poxmilers
cost your farm
but not for me as a farherway
it's that simple
this really is the towe of two cities
it's a long a way from home
as you went to a rere part of a shop
in lots of things think about
i'm still happy
you must have a personal qukey
we were on it together
it will be a great investment
or properties should i say
putt it on the outside
because it was officas
very close by the university
ground floor flat
i would market that
add another ten on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment s around you and
probably around 85
and since the conversion
realistic value wise
she was a floodhip
even before sh entered the water
visiting almost all parts of the empire
from small ships
as it true she was
sometimes it's difficult to know where
if you intnd to bid on the place
it's hard to come away from it
it seems a very good location
because the demand of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of the location
what was it that made you think
how can i do with that
destroying the property
purely by chance
are they struggling or are they flushed with success
he is my filder
we're puting a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic book villain
and then of course
desperate to prove your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discoverevery
protected from the prevailing wits
searching for answers
we know what they are
there's no obvious reason

not just i can tell
not just in this time
every september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his part of point
there is no one so there is no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only 1en minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new build property should be youon't how any works to do
some issues with potential damp
great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just relying on this information
all of the brains combining all of the senses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
it' is very similar
or have they encountered propolateies
and turning upstairs into an open plann area is definitely the way to go
travel three miles forur the west and you do get more for your money here
if that was fitted out
will it be a fun
fably project for them
will it be a bove par
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
and things like that world well do ourselves
this auction lot has it in spain
if you can't go up
its cosmetically improved quite drastically hereah
on the second floor
it's very clean
