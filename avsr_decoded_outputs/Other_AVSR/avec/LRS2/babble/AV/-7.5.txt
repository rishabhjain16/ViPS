and thought for me the surprise was
so movely wend
and we were friend
you't actually
whether it's much elseier in the garden
so you've seen ourf fox home
whi uil november
we can just aboutke it well with it now
something a little guden compost
it's all about diarzs
and if you what wonderful
started with the compass
for the brief time
they w' change lives
w my husband and i are not round
please donate now
don't forget me
things in my works
it would have been completely galient to the rest of london
but i think what we're seeing here isid of the blue pras
he was so popular
instead of being soere' noting handsi
in't expected do to have a puist to
see how much it comes
iet's pay the money
ater the course of his life
we did' finish
but before i do
this house will just come together and flourish
any man will be proud to have view as a son
but that didn't take
get them into the garden
this one is totally out of control
it comes to goes
it's part of the natural garden scheme
i think it's brillant
one bedroom first floor flat
if you're going to be increasing
but it's the deas sight
i'm not passively happyer
if you are looking around in auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a nice substantial house so well
they get it done on time and the right money
but what surprise when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
needs to looking at to sal it
it's a lot easier and lots
stuk to what you' go like
that is important
but it's a really well
i do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up prevent you for theol the makers on an island bahamas
i couldn't wait
exccepted largeer resal
you never know by the end of the bidders
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like a green roof
we've got a great relationship
whife' the cas
some members of the public don't goall understanding so older
if you live it in the building
well you want new neie is everyhere or every four night
but i think it's already lk some really important property lessons
youid a good location
you have to hold a cork nerve
who's protinical family history
i would spend more than
exaly it wouldon't be
think's something drasting needs to be done
what do you wrp about it
i'm writing toay that
time has passed
so let's go back and find out
very impreicsed
the best pocket is
not quite as high
it's a blus point
on the face of it
the first end set floor flats
as a residn of smoking
we'll give a try
go to the praital
i the roups
eight feet tall
and the really for that
a little sexor fru
whever you are
it may be a mitch compa that
i applant themim the next pott
sometimes in gather
i think it looks it riat
it's a quite large liaf
and it's a great way to eat
that first paining
but no we have these viruses
were all box fiers
it causes us your harm
but not for me as a farming
it's that simple
this really is a t1n of two cityies
it's a long away from home
as you entered the rare part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm just so happy
who must have a berson here
we were looking together
it would be a greating investment
or property just say
bring it on the outside
because it was offices
very close to by the university
grand forest flates
i would market that
and this ta on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment around there at a moment
probably around 95
and sein as the conversion
realistic value work
she was a floor shrip
given him fost chat to the water
visiting on which all parts of the empire
from small chips
as a truth she was
sometimes it's difficult know where
if you intend to belon a place
it's s to c awaiting for me
it seems a very good location
but it's afferent amount of the market
it might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it maad and you think
how could i do that
i'll destroy the property
you the b shots
they struggling or are they inflused with the scess
here is my a builder
we plant our pan together
after just a couple of decays
just like any good comic bill
and of course
desperate the beautiful your bizarre theor
but since jet's first and d scuffing
prtended from the provailing wins
searching of frrances
we know and what they are
there's no ofpfious rerasons
taking horticulture to the kast fm
the whole gardens are extraorinary hands
like hundreds of thousands of people do whatever
me now there's more potential

this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multic consortce
on the face of it
buying a new build property should mad just't have any work to
so assure yous with potential damp
