and for me that the surprise was
they're movingrou
and we were fright
and the next day
whether it's much else in the garden
sort've seeten half foxober
well into november
we just about get away with it now
something like a garden compost
it's not all about a size
and if you want wonderful
started with a compost
for a brief time
eat will change lives
when my husband and i and not around
please don it now
don't forget me
things in my words
it would have been completely alalien to the rest of london
but i think what we'll seere was kide of the blue biit
he was so popular
instead of being someone's arm katteer
i expected you to have a plast
see how much de it comes to
i paay the money
after the course of his life
when it's finished
but before i do
this house would has come together and flourished
any man will be proud to have view as a son
at the end of the day
get them into garden
this one is totally out of control
but it comes to goats
it's part of the natural garden scheme
i think it's brongent
one bedroom first floor flat
if it was going to be increased
but it's a decent size
i'm notpassively happier
if you are looking around at auction properties before the auction
it's a very attractive guide price for a substantial house so well
did they get it done on time and for the right money
but what is a surprise when you come in
because it is fantastic
what do you think about that
he's looking to sell it
it's a lot as easi as it looks
sticks of what you're good at
that is important
but it did really well
and do what i used to do when i was a little boy
i'm starting up a venue for youang holiday makers on an island bahamas
i couldn't wait it
exccepted a large resort
you never know by the end of the build
i know it comes with planning permission
but we're going to improve on things like the green roof
we've got a great relationship
where is the gas
some nmbers the public don't quite understand leasehold
if you lift in the building
was you w new nibors everywhere or every foronenight
but i think he's really like some really important property lessons
using a good location
you have to hold your nerve
who's very machin to family history
we don't want to spend more than
exactly it won't be
i think something dreasing needs to be done
what do you know about it
i'm wriiting to say that
time has passed
so let's go back and find out
i' very impressed
the best bargains
not quite as high
it's a bl point
on the face of it
the first andnd second floor flats
as a result of smoking
we'll give a try
go to the breslea
new rops
eight feet tall
and then reallyon for that
a little saxon for us
wherever you are
it may be a militaring complan to that
i applot them in that spot
sometimes it doesn't
i think it looks great
it's quite a large leaf
and it's a great way to eat it
that first meining
but no we have these viruses
squirrel pox fires
couses to your harm
but not for me as a farming
it's that simple
this really is the tlle of two cities
it's a long way from home
and you enter the rare part of the shop
lots of things to think about
i'm soill happy
who must have a personal key
we were allold it together
it will be a great investment
or properties should i say
brety on the outside
because it was offices
very close by the university
grand floor flat
i would market that
add another ten on
for this property
but in this case
one bedroom apartment and there at a moment
probably around 85
and since the conversion
reallyistic value wise
she was a floyd trip
even be fushnd to the water
visiting on which all parts of the impare
from small ships
as as sure she was
sometimes it's difficult where
if you intend to bid on a place
it's started up away from it
it seems a very good location
because of the demand of the market
they might be viable
that's my kind of location
what was it that made you think
how can i do that
destroying the property
turely p chance
are they struggling or are they enlushed with a success
he is my builder
we planted a band together
after just a couple of days
just like any good comic pulvillain
and then of course
desperate topprove your bizarre theory
but since jack's first discovery
protected from the providiling and wins
searching for frances
we know and what they are
there's no obvious reason
taking horticulture to the es fre he
the whole gardens are extraordinary hand
like hundreds of thousands of people do whatever
but now there's more potential
about 20 years ago
and a couple of weeks catter
enjoy the summer
are their relatives of yourws
not just so whose help
but the water of the story
and i will up sh to go back
not just so whole telm
not just in this town
eby september this place would be transformed into what was
for over 700 years
so from his vantage point
there is no here so there is no sound
with one of the rooms upstairs
which is only ten minutes away
this is a sweet
before we all get too excited about that prospect
it can be quite expensive
it's a multicultural
on the face of it
buying a new build property should mean you don't have any work to
some issues with potential and damp
a great place for him to be
we have to pay for that
so rather than just rely on this information
all the brains combining all the different senses
who doesn't have vision
so you have your bathroom in this area and then
when i see that
and i wouldn't be surprised
this is very similar
or have they encountered problems
and turning upstairs into an open plan area is definitely the way to go
travel three miles far the west and you do get more few money here
if that was fitted out
will it be a fun
fabulous project for them
will it be above part
that's an option
that's very bad news
and that's really well done
it takes hard work
thingends like that we'll do ourselves
this auction lot has it in spain
if you can't go up
it's dmatically improved quite drastically here
on the second floor
it's very clean
the appliances have been done nicely
it could be your passport to a small fortune
in other words made the base
garage and techck on funk
and not imach
look at me at all
because i must say
the following spring
over the last two weeks
and that's all about
i tend to use natural british stone
if you travel in the world
here in the screenhouse and the other oneld
's sh your cal
is it all good news
why are many supermarkets stopping selling caling decks
free range good
to make it work
very few remain
or take it its all in
one north in welsh ruer
for the first time
formally acknledgeed tital as the preinicce of wales
and here on top of the eedle tower
which is now it silly
according to legend
that was a blank canvas
in the first year alone
and she lay dying
the garrison responded with a hail of arrows
and when you're moving through any me territory
the garrison tried to surrender before he can try out his new toy
he ordered them back inside
you don't deserve my grace
taking no chances
tearing it intsto the ground
according to legend
there was a portor colours
people sat on the stairs
which is i did for it
cracks will appear
someone came out of neighbour property and said
very expensive shed
without my sutin lesson
even the foreplate
and then when it came to his signature
it's a making show
she's pushed herselves
it sous ron
whatond if you looked
children and adults like
that'such shocking percentage
i'm just hopeful
we have a lot less atmosphere above us
no longer would measurement be based on the human boilyor
they'll loo get dependent on the sun
while i'm surrounded by water right now
thanks to watching
our continued pressure
and in flammisging photograph

to say to the king
when he was in the gy at the palace
home to an animal that is right at the top of the food chain

which melts more ice
think about the melting sea ice
again open to the elements
very attractive young woman

neutrons and electrons
but when you open the box
that's not right
this universe

12 miles in a hamets
scretching back sweet
staggering on the edge of space
pondering in the immenseing
we live in a tiny
thanks for watching
you think i did this
this is all about rarity
as opposed to chinese
but i couldn't believe it would be true
if you've got to do it
and a man who made the discovery
but everyone goes into the den gets a fresh chance to turn things round
you just have to grab an opportunity when it presents itself
but slightly rebellous sooncks
don't forget that scir grow
maybe somewhere nice and safe
i'm not sure what's most of all get right
gardens never finished
you should never be put off
people getting in touch and wanting to rectify rolls
there are times i like tenicipan rama
and yet that and fish and chips
this isas calmed down
the they just got weirder and weirder
back to the history books

to be a successful entrepreneur
i just don't get him
and i think this is one
something like that
with corrupt governments
because of the small slize
it can mean more matches
and more money for a favour
pleased with himself
as servia is pandemonium laninos
there are no recording ofloy georgian at the peak of his powers
which was the matchin newspaper
and it was very old to h children
and would have mention amarrian after his wife
with that flourish
what you need to do is get the very much brians
and very much talent
the most thejacked people in
because the empire
it's often forgotten
which is absolutely understandable
he hoped to return to power
weould not be a happy place
depending on train
my great great grandfather

if it gives me some sort of control back
