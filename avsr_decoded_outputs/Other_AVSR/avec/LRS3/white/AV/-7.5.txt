i would read them about it but what would mean about my career
i d' but
i' doctor

but too often my treatment maade them feel worse
i looked after 20 f them
so i look a frediction
why is that
differen the do i sh just not felt
i want differencees maybe
i would ma sain
i think what that means that people couldn't see what was infonidt of them
the good
the points you make me of home
it wasn't like them to mis practice
present you to do that
i don't want to
it's not the craby
a that's what need fndibin har
they need the jockb
the a
i'm in crucii be right now
what is the abstraction
you no question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an oper all day long
that's what've moved you
i know you understand that
i' i didn to fst in the world
we're now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind ofid reality
and it's hard it's curious but that's why were lieri
nobody comes to get famous
how we do that
so nally h really daffereit
and it doesn't
this date deplury a global mountain campaign
it should be inspiring
how you for surek
we created a d that success
you must somming
that is not simply irk w
i remember we experienc with this
in other words a order to find these thing a fatal recipe
what can we do of f it
roughly 3700rou visions
what do we need to do
thank you very much
he surprised me i say you know what
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to tate for myself
patron is not boys anman
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survival of all forms of sexual abuse including three
guess whats con valley
i've tried engageing people
and they also that they tapen to the workforce
d yout know
people d' re
people start totmune ideas
that's actually what happens
ri this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
how w the with family
but last have changed
but just imagine for a moment what l me to feel like
when you train them however you just
me you want we dan the room or the plan saybrats we did get d
and that's exactly what they is
remember call closh
you needs be have to do something with it
we always done many freshion
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how are you to informed
so it's the demand that ring deception
there's no more of it
so we da out get a slightly different way
we make two or three times more than anybody else
l's go back if it's an question
sustainability it got to be a pretcompedit
even if we did everybody working we've got theimentor reationion
so what buttter tw it
well that's going to be bretingrou propction
i don't have the uni fe
let me give you a simple deimission example
more just is not theen aing daf
just is' respondent
because is different by other people
we can do it two people cath and chrld to improve ch just
theamone the position
again coo
thousand ofomen started rech out on me to show their own steries of pain an shame
i respect to fight
not a lot of cats
i wish you w to prach for meaoraid what
christmas d dcriminate

but now chat up where they go on a treeve life
it's just not possible
ie that's p reat
noting every day
looking looking and find in love
i wre you
and this is this problem
but the dre' watching
it makes more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like rey did i really have tomotke cer
it's not that they didn't want me the greed
you can't run around in the dark
what i do about it
leny have happened without thinking about it
you'll never walk
et's ho on that converge to me
'ake a pie of jokm me to be thrown away
you've broken you back
that really knowledge
these guys can be goodoo putpose wh was very word gs
we need to be part of a community to survive
it is about quality
we all learn the bzide with the answerers
we've noticed we were baby
i started looking at themim ret carefully
it's about systems
i looked at my friend deaf ray well raning off more than a billiones for the
it's very hard to make to putt a very ragical decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we lock ourselves in the room for you day and we try to figure out we're about us together
well we rejected all of that
we looks like what it feels like and most of our we cre values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brain do down with somebody else's dissue
the movements the banding changed knew when they were k crashing poverty 
we very often we think about political change and defined apartment day
so i want to talk to you today and what i think is a much more b recipe for deeper
a couple of years ago a group ofa decided that we were inating the limits of what we accomplished
that's what im de it
not part of the same me this
were part of the same family

and we were prepared we don't forget
didn are my children
i didn't know what to say
we can build healthy of relationships around race if we dnt coverlate ok
on the other hand that the subject that you could it should you
so just like with the bike we don't talk about it
then iop talking about this is us
youould try it
everything you w to day
and that puts you my mind
couse that
that's nothing special
i had no choice
it had no choice
i realized of course that all countries are reat
just what that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get tug to mess up
one of them grew up in roota
my mother was on the line to tell me that dor she felt lumpicmer answer

ding is a 100 open rate
he told me not thearly one
i think it might be a lifeline
that last oneter actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we need to build the crazy next onli
who's that the event
i am doing myhing
whate really is about the puton the way they were put things like that
it sentible difference rate
they supported me all theay through it
that's something we had to dele brate
beter
we're plusced withere people who listen to us
ep it wrong
did not each infaded the netherlands
when i get out s ofv it i am i going to be rejected
at some point i re
we really don't want anymore
we' love to help
block their flams
we have no sen patts
we should came int off the top of the lens at the most interested in america
i rerad the name to police department because of that
and all of these matters are crazy because we're probably savingomething is the most important function of
but when you started to look at the data was by the way if their judges don't have when we took to look at the data
so i decided to focus on you design anthole to help make their most critical decision
and at the op other as the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
ct tend tocy
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level trin dasces on the streets just arouf the orarter from our office interesting
about trim about violence
some people call it daite
and one of them sa we had grabmed two wees ago
and they would take a yllow city they would writ them the night and they would put it up on the boarder
they haven't yet been convinced of the crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to adminature they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i felt the exact same way that i think about the dative
so when i started my job to go the foundation i came back looking a lot of these questions and i came back to
we have no depect
now at l that time came to luersey was the most interesting in america
and when i talk to juchere around the united states which i do all the time now they c all see the same
they're led to biebur down 20 years ago
he compacks everything
it worked for the old da and it worked in the state of luture sam
they're just waiting for their day and course

they don't represent the work onter fusw st arey
we had to the battle between jeffanesis aaitin

how do we do that
you sa you're worred more than hous
let's s funing drower the day
but you can waite it
that's even if you working a way more than full time hours
how are do we great ie this
chinese the world try to secnd a profity program over the last fore decades
an some of underangeuren probably do
this natual connective issue
can we really yell
they had the boint to me
but you know what the acts with fats are
but now it's turned around
i can't get terby
my history wasn't right
without s me really dafated with others
my de very powerful
and it is important
we can only think of one way
we're talking about the values in which those public spaces where we come together
that in the world unless we find the way to globalize the bulb or

and we're got
wereg we want annder m
should always fall a way down from what you should be
we need to create a global parliament of pars
they are doing it dat
a new opportunity to addition of new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have is
they were be invisible
of course myigration will become even more important
and the change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the firstan people i have the chould
because we have the damp to
i was i realized i was baz it worse
was able to do more th
why my change developrism
that was pow of you
what she
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable danors
that was a huge problem overwight
it's about the kid
i'm not strong enou toft me carry on man from your round caryll
me you couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which bijing grow
going
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformation climate transmition we have to dcide to do
and looking at that pattern
he's notght a dountable
that sort of tv
now we want to do a soupbleoup of the age way of coming through
so they turn them to seem safe place
you sha how
in fact what's theame your my brain
we now have a planfirm
and my word d become
i us
i'm a professor i repasion about education
well we' bou one of the

but there's actually more d gooder than that
all w never
that different is how molecules are put together
effectively the dog de poletgan a complete blackout for any other source of information

im thinking of rough me
being through my body with the fails of my fil
i am talking about you lif for me
remember when i dent my lifve
and i kind of know
i remember when you said to me

that means at some point it's going to be new problem to you
how is that
it
they lead to a very powerful to
and that might be the case
thank you very much
we creat an indentrialz statement that has the same efficiency of monopolite
we see everything wkipedia
it's the positiveiew that's constantly changing me updated
and how is that possible
imrong say we don't have banymins
they have manices
the bos to rate out creativev there
i'm the opposite
people hear aboutu gratad betent job up br
they know you can fail b startcks backript or my filing start mis
because each here the winnter has come from a different credible group
they have to be able to teacher something as well
and in that lctor
and this wasn interesting i was trying to question
i cantare myself away from the cfnce
african americans supported at a higher level than had never been recorded
and others redect compareis between right different right and
we're looking for something more
do you like mgic
you just have to find another term and look at that up
me it's not that clean
that mayght always be the case
we can change our own minds
theyre blete the fact and themission they called book characters
i got about 3000 mares
mic a website

but there's so much potential
this is about proving who you are ich is

you just not a do thing sometimes
so we con't get a new c
and boor they were like w
but thats somethan that we can't
now that's a very good bo
what w wrong
we have to decidn what it means
but this is the way i could from in life outrich people
the answer wor thank
