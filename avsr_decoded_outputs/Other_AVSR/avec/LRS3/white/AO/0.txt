otherwisfe millions more will diale
and i w you be fared
you don't get the same wichess as the depositions
maybe i the b aboutheist to do

the answer was no
african american supported it at a higher level than had ever seen beforeed
and it is it
they're looking and looking and finding lge
it's right there for you to find
but people did not relationhip
that's a very very good point
and lovely every day
we've suspended our values
sustainability has got to be a preeompetitive

fun you say alwthu stuff about myself
the only thing heemo thlf

let's think about your ethical fokpriners
but for too many women that's not the caste

in other words a coreigner to find these things to can gift the fatt
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing mooms
carrists are doing this
we wanted toequality at the government level

this is possible
let's go d this
you are heil an expony village

we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievment

they're often not working them at hold
i'm fallow you right now
that is the real world and unless we find the way to globalize democracy or
so i started a research positic
one woman no longer than level ever find her
they want to know how much emper sie your dogs is sa
but you know what
but the magnitude is the fallllm is something we need to appreciate
we lack valuable data
and so we you do better at coping their nationural environment get into drivee
did i get my upright
they want to know how often the dogs outside
here's the flip side as well
we are talking about the enus in which those public spaces where we come together
the you gells
where do refugee want to go
so i set again quite forming on my browd
why aren't we supposed to have a connection with every single pasent
i wanted to understand who takes the that
or're in there
i believe the story there had to be pold
i can part with
i'm not strong enough to li i carry on back from the rain to the cartceef
but it's not about fire and beesgone either
pretty simple is you right
i would traas my own dr
but event sil they've been tomorrow
but if you want rulves we'll have no choice at to runing the a
you can't hide behind anything other than your own peah
i think we need something like a manhattan dri on the topic arff can pay r
you just live away
to de learn to what your hands ischool
you thall him m that
but it's also an important day another reasonch
i was always very smart
and i want to make the point that as members of societies we need to here
was in most of the time i had to recarted over and over before it was
and use is what creates in mct
so how does this work
but i can't one
i femow i neher was onen and not the other
it shows no bock
i love wen
we don't have enough money
so what guys
can' to understand how this can happen
i tried everything
l we can bring the imagination to life and move to the mind that all of our bonds can e
and this change is getting more racorids
you even need that the canan be am contaent
what do they have
in fact south africa has not gone down that lo
you can change own minds
why are people over it
and in that i need to pur you
they'll at the single moment in the schedle
that's what happen with my dad
the feces brooodcasft arest
so let's get started now
let's not we say it's impossible
there were others like myself who were full times
coniden they are m be
it churs wayen taught
and when she went complained to a major she said what
again it will not happen on the night
but the second of the tan the climate san we have to decide to
we have a common cold
that's terrible we time
and he couldn't give the turn it off
efficiency is four rbot
more trust is not an intelligent a in this life
second your e in barsting
they canelt get what they need when they need it
so that's mobel maniopulation
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time in the most valuable hmoities arepressed water
i seen geremy french
but you think togethern it should redistrib
and to do so we had to beied andpalpble thingge
showed you the live day by talking about it with your children your co ofers your friends and
and that s actually what happens
i'd like to make a suggestion that we don't need to anim for that to make substantial progress
pa theis
he's a bad guy
and he said where is he out
it's about the data
he let other people worry about
another social problem that
is not a tament on thenutrition or anything on
i am thinking with a wor for me
i think it up as all the time
i'm not professor and was passionate about education
that wasn't case to me
they unlible to expect if we minister they were he toginner theyre limited to the local
we very often you think about political change and defines who part
if you don't want this
of course we are going to go even deeper than the human body
again it had no choice
i sut shaying
can i go that
and i said to myself i want to get me int of there
but i'm wh that have be
how far we we going to find
you have't ear it
you' cut that
i was terrified
indeed theon thearth of making things works
two sid the a
is a bit is of a difficult thing sh to put up on the screen
that's for the state of the art
now i'm madbe from an inviere
don'ted about them to eat fet
it needs to happen
thank you very much
and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that we're taking before something
why is the important n
infordable help benefits
if you know what the actal facts are
we're not so needed
they change some persons as persent
and then what happens
and then this is the problem
bid mess
after all i wased that i'm convinionent
18060 a di
to find the gold
you not for you
i could ever do that
all of you are meember to try
is a performance fend
actually not that hard
i d you know what to think
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
we don't thin it we don't re gve jo
you want to work for
i have three thoughts to i see how they' sight
this is completely bu
you watch the money
e theage of our blefriends or the world banks
the plane take gof
we tuff it so much
that was a key problem at the uay earthplace
we're not going to be able to do that
this so i thought why not pllish myself
they go ca
it means for you and it's for you our pv cs
nobody comes to get samess
and nothing happened at all
and in fa it probably lang
and looking at that pattern
like it sa
wh is that
what you about
so for sze if this is offer a cough quity education to everyone around the world for free
and they don't used to ask permission
i do believe we can fix what's broken
you don't have to bringe because the watering vayer are free
you have to be able to teach something as well
and he surprised me by saying you know what
teectting has a 100 open rate
w' that change the fality of life in these systemce
that only if you're paid by the hours
i don't know

don't thin get an me on the person
everything you need that worres out
we bought one of these
you can walk around them
we know that every film has affection
what about m leger k
and go
why are you
like i' probably happen every day
and she there's a lot of things that just don't have data
but this is why i heard from a lot of culca thank
my history wn't knowear
so if you pook to everybody to learn how to do to ln
one woman think of her head
i didn't give the d
youont w it so hard
when we share ideas we all get more
and this rechame went on for some time
is incredibly high
this meess that the movement s mandity changee with a da but they povery why
did you care your phone mind
it have been the water
thould fw it
we always can make it profit
art is not efficient
it there's no other way
you look a aboutop that way you of giving thata
how is get made
my desire to disappear is still very careful
a theain in a car
and then we were alarned to discover something
and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplant
that may not always communication
at some point i'm going to get out

and cully ok in what to j
so when you got cucked the ce in i 4

you have to have a high tech experience of pregnantcy otherwise something like you're wrong
and when we're unprepared the over the a
and dn it mattter
tell me that that
it's not a lot of money at the global level
we're on the grid
one way around this is to draw a picture
and they say i want working to behind me but what will it mean about my career
dan replies so often you won't need to know the
i looked at my friend to build cousin dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars to the
it's with about people

he kept one in the global compartment of our cm
there' are people everywhere
and he the that
i think it might be a lifeline
nll i didn't have any idea
i can use it in my company
i didn't talk to them
and that's exactly what that is
look at eic the animal
i thean the campon police department because of that
now issvery different that
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
what is harful
and guess what filk upon valley
i would not befraat
were going down to the cellular level these days
you don't talt them in
why would it know
so thank you very much
i had no idea
but that is the mean that we can
it's the whole internet
so we have the feech and samndon cycles
like why did i really have to move al
i can stand up and do somhing
i should make that decision
you can get volunteers
rem not you're walking in the forest and you see a b
and they put on and off their oh my themain
for becoming the keytack of a new lgage
i'm older new
someone who has that kind of artistic pessential deseres so much more
re hening ford others
his name is ronnie and hev a veteran vietnam
websae
it would be a mall inount of cnt
it kind of the anti reality tod
l you
that robot could on a graat show
suggest that they need the first in many cationes with oxygen
as to walk in the community and we take a lot of scientistes to realize that they want to
have to get fired
i dotse thin
i do like magic
qui the alic
youould cannd them off the tat of the list as the may thing to be america
and here's what you need to know
i'm here to tell you the story of prazy love a psychological trafh the guise lo when
i want you to do
they not to doher
it's not one way
so when i started my dad at the armo tndion i kame ba to looking at a lot of besepection and i kide back
fed inor theo while
none of these studies found that people fend more and drink it with cosen that people
i take it to therapy
ma could go away
and it just graduated from harvard clege
i know i didn't
and i did not know what to fake
and then at 11'clock he stopped talking about thesew issues
china is the world greater pana coy for thatver the last few decades
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
i you never go to your house you never come to my hef
coming to aa to be the data in the minic
the boys reminded you of pome
and how do they find
kind exactly got the plane
if you can fy it
what is the i be a droy
and this powerful
20erc could get to do that
so that is easy
i i ask all of the faith to be thatth in sic
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
to be lvers with cou
that those they are features some are atconst
they're completely clcked they' basically cudbod characters
fm of theirs coming up
and then i thought it gou to be a better way
i don't lk diffina
my mother was on the line tell me that sothorce had found a lump in the somach some of cancer
this is your chiest
don't happen thatp
think about that
what would happen
for any national leader
wealth is lifed away from people who simply call uroeducted
what different isould make the talkic ch find shell
where would it go
if the decades shet people down on an airplane
to me it's not that clear
the oic is don't make sense because it's the wrong question
how is that palkingionble
it maybe go wet
hee i thenerestion pwking to me
what kind ofion was for you
to unexpected caver
are we brave enough to
it goes wrong
i know i was one of the first 10 people to have this thirst ree
my research in mind went to west point military cathy
no more charge for you
one thensat her face
it's a pucking aude
but things have changed
because in a way de constu a fororble diseases
a couple of years ago if you could like in canada decided that we were hitting the limit of what we could accomplished
i am full of contradictions
i'll let you continue
whyon't we get severaledght
foo and stood up the food
but that's kind of the problem
we change the economic for the bad guys
it wasn't who i was
that is great
we have nose suffects
even not looking
i you did a world fark
i have cyclle his life and darnic
only 1 of the people exe farmers
but you'll notice we're not at the confident amountain yet
we now have a moral telf that is in the tradition of others that we have
but before that cooperation to bejoy heny was proascinated and that for the you
but i'm going to shrow healthy
they haven't yet been convicted of a timrime
he is n not s to a baby
they want equrisal
and myher world did open up
i was not going to trind myself to fe
she can't identify with thater
what i worn with
and i don't have to do anything
theydenef waiting for their day for
have to bld right now
i had to do something
with the fenou
the ied so obvious but i
forortunate it is so important
and then get poin
they don't even more traat to continue
what if it bees to these business cause the instal resistance all
that eing resuls
i wanted to get to know that as individual
that is not simply pit the p
we've done theatar
i didn't feel i didn't be wrong body
so what can you do
social change doesn't happen in the arab regan through dramatic concenttations
i i don't understand
f me the that's your pu
i remember what it was
so what to do next
and boy they were like what
we're seeing the baby brain
we know wh i could st't learn
so what do you think happens to do yourself
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and the aken help us
thank you very much
what a contribution
what if you have thet
and in many cases you don't
i was likely to with you
trying bec a beter pression
it loves your helse
let me teow you that a couple
i'm the government but i'm a rather dad one
and it doesn't
it came from the way in which daing his stow
but to of our drntilldn probably will
and we don't leave them where they are
they're nothing sis that fills
what can i do about it
there there's so much potential
you'll never walk again
but we only get one history as the one that we have
or city can possibly handle any pes
and they would ick a yellow fik and they would wak up there and put it up on them
we might say them we l not spy at this
you don't wor about how computer work
you mind about h rife
often i self all this
your motcasious
we guess what
i teach a stanord
but it's different
and whats what i'm paying for here now
and after that initial prototype we set out to make f and aical software so that others would not have
that even small fale farmers can neverage
how you know for sure
i i guess i'm heing it right now
i know i have
the first lesson is about the reion
what i need now is to known to do like that
the oil will never run out
and that blew my mind
they're not my ching
and theis fool
pretty much everybody else you goes pld
and other presented d comparison life gi a life and
it's an automatic process
you've probably walked
you'll reconile a lt difference right
why you c not work
how do you get to build gose relationships
you cut thean
and we finally figured out how to do it
i want no part of any of that
that's the magic of the geological record
how does that work
and they were basically having fun
profecially when it comes to pilate shif
they need to force
how is that possible
what the reacly w
we only show you airportf
whic is how stuff has made memorbi
and i cried
i know you understand that
lo it now
there's nothing underground about it
it's irresponsible
he h the right thing st that
c good not everybody
you econom me usa
but you know what
they are going well
it ifs not a beiry word
so was mother parent
my brother a lott v that i am
you know about numbany
so we lockst ourselves in the room depating and we tred to figure out what found us together
now i will ma p
the te ok
there is no more of it
and thats what
by firstth days
women are worth it
so i wd like to leave you with these thoughts
how are we going to do that
the too often my treatments made them feel workse
and that should be deal for profession with c hiden mannd
who would i meed
so i decided to focus on even data an ayithic to help make the my critical defusioness
they get care to walk around
what do do
so we need the collution and these people play the themain they are finding out
how ofltould you takeking my dis
it's been thought about for a while
but i'm a big fan of you a person
they've supported me all way through it
is a really important chap to to make
we were obviously making a difference
we created a diagnosic test
and the physician practicing with cutting edge technology
iould traed on with my neighbors
why not if that thisiness is compete
they feel at home
' need
was the inter actually a place that you could visit
it impact time environment
so we createed a new sip
i said did not know this
if any child is found violating he rul he isverely repommended
i want to know how i yougestion
that long tm the national text message that we acee
you had no choice
that will change everything when we do that
so i went in lave with
why didn't you become that
so nuch to ask what d afterican
i'm als long this mission because the very juste pciou medicine cantooue to
it's more complicated
comomphing is drong
it's all about what you use you for me
but inact fludging foo
i understand the relationship
do like fcki
it's a composit f that's constantly changing you updated
i went to stree linkth to try to be straight
i'm like ford
we were born to
we just need to alhllic
so bear with you
i know thatfms i know to fear they put me on the internet when i was doing on at
i don tt have anyve
to hit that i right anyway
but when you start to look at the data by the ways thech others don't have and we start to look at the dat
how do you change your behavior
with move and friendship and conpection
s not what i een expected
china's constrained in terms of how much more land that actually has available to agriculture and it has nothived
either we invent labor organized
they have facial meat
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive some placees place
i ne think i'm saying to take my pictures
and that ev if you're working way more than four times a
i feel that god know
you know what el you d
i became a psychologyaper and i devoted my work to understanding the humanpphy to care for others
we wornt considd the real thing
the engine failed
the parents are so foroar they have more resources to get them back
she thaw hitt me down to
they want the game
so iearned never to move
one of them got culled up in the wat
but it's not enough
she can pact everything
i would never want to do that
well that'sould find it
and whatort is that possible
we used to have the manufacturing economyic without building duit and product and now we have a pervical
the cream for is fall and lay down to what it needs to be
sif different wine
we created a disruption of real life and important work
we can do that because we know
i'm a 15th generation pten
and that's really what i find so intriued about the reaction that we had the
and i said i don't mind
not the wife not the kids
effectively the taribam creates a complete blacker of any other source of information
i nothing
most of the kenedia was shut down
come out of a place called the gallu organizations
and he' pured up the importance of coaking voice and com men and changing the culture the locking room and giving
and we don't know this a h reght
it makes we have to do something with us
they were right
i even ret and you fel helpflis
i enjoyed fact and meticins a pretty sa
you say you're worooking more than 50ours
