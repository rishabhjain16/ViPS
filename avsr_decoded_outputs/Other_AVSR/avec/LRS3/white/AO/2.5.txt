i want to be part of it
and they sayid i want to working gal povert but what would it mean about my career
i don't know
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
the too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
why you that
what differences that make it they talk like ory figind cell
what diffnt futs made
now i will make hain that
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
liice is shood
the boys re minded me at home
it wasn't like them to thiske practice
1 to get to do that
i didn't want to
i fed in arabic
after college i definitely needed plind a face to call home
fazingit the jack part
look at end to the animal
i'm in the pap right now
what if the abst
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an off they're all n notght lonone
that's what needs you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the wall
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievm
it kind of the anti reality t g
and it's hard and it takes courage that's why we're alive
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so nur to get ask what is afric
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy of global nowar campaigns
it should be inspiring
how do you know for sure
we creed a diagnostic test
i am fift to my stamach
that is not simply citical to us m
and and remember we had experienceed with them
in other words a corener to find these things to chay thisift because dat ehdce
what can we do in all of that
roughly 300 taingsenerans in walls roughly 600 in years
what do you used to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
i'm going to say all so some stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stanse to myself
hatriarchy is not voys and men
i started to write about sharing the facts that i m the survivor of all forms of sexvies comcluing f
and guess what silicon valley
i tried toengaging people
and they also knew that they could happen to workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people started to do the ideas
and that s actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super fal and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
which is no structure
out toginn with families
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
you do train them however to adjust how she according to where they are
he wanted to sit wh he could stand in the room or he could fan cape routt he could get his hand
and that is exactly what that is
you're go to call
it need to have to do something with it
we're always trying to make it profit
at the same sign
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings thematfici
there's no more of
so we did the analysis again a slightly diffnt way
we take two to three times more than anybody else
l' go back and visit our equations
sustainability has got to be a precompetitiveation
even if we get everybody iss working on we've got to be strategs
so was mother tourism
or that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have an overhoo
let me give it a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it's given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to incrode cras
you look at the same witness as positions
again in a car
thousands of women started reachking out me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shames
i was petrified
not a lot of hands
and when she went to complain to a major she said what
that what we're asking doesn't exciminate
people just see it
say all the the shamin about very mu i ne your first popculation
i think about it all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
and theirs had progressed
and happily every day
they are looking and looking and finding large
why are you
i need this with the problem
beeta gills in barston
thk more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like why did i really have to move along
it's not that they didn't want me for critically
you can't un around in the dark
what can i do about it
if letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
so let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
and you're brop int the back
that he you really acknowledged
you guys should be true to the purpose that are finding or than gass
we need to be part of the community to survive
is thin about quality
we all know the inside with the answers
we notso to a baby
i started looking at them really care fe
it is about systems
i looked at my friends who briiled sezen dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and reviting with tremendous first
so we locked ourselves in a room for tatings and we tried to figure out what found us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of what its fore value are
especially when it comes to plimate fa
but in the process they also train our brain to cheat out with somebody else's issues
this meants that the movement to maandity change knew with a a ga forrusthing poverty widing
well very often you think about political change and defines com partners species
so i want to talk to you today about when i think there's a much moreprete recipe for deep
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limit of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just part of the same species
we're part of the thinge family
i have fre fight and i see how they fight
and i won't nam names you know who you are
you see it is a disruption of real life and important work
you go' dome this
10 degrees f a year old
you destroy all the bone marrow andrancipitation with massive dooces of chemotherapist
and she suffered so much
small and the friendship and the detection
it could be merged
the question why does you say
which is why that i belive degree and the waly job in was great tiny future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love of psychological trafh theisguise with love one
we kept one in the glov compartment of our car
and heres where those gun can know
i had to graduated from harvard college
show of use for live day by talking about it with your children your cow workers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to step
i would justive the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds greek until you figure out where it's really going
and when we're unprepared we overreact
they're not my sison
and i did not know what to sa
we can theirn healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locatees
on the other hand statistics it's the subject that you could and should us
so just like with a bike you don't talk about it
and then at 11'lock he stoped talking about thesel issues
you can frive
everything in the universe worars out
and that blew my mind
huck that
that's nothing special
again we had no choice
it had no choice
i realized the course that all countries are used
just when that's the last thing y
you don't get a chance to mess of up
one of them got caued up in the water
my mother was on the line tell me that doctors had found a lump in the stomach fromim the cancer
the choic is don't make sense because it's the wrong question
i thought we should just say home
but we decided to go to the mind
i feel that god knows
he wote that
i tacked alone with my neighbours
from me you goir
and i said to myself i want to get me on that
i feel failty sometimes
you want to work for him
boy it not of a lot
what you need
you could break guye
so i'm not saying that thing in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
the jardens be treating
the science is there
they did drive better decision
there's going to be new system based on donated practic strehing technologies the redigou company that i work for
were not there yet
and she's a lot of things you just don't have datau
if that you can actually trigger eide fundies the forusris can happen
it the win all around
the coming of age to bring the data into theumanitaryan world

se some germany and frence
surely we know in it
four times the message for some
you have to get iet

what can you do it
there's a flip side as well
iff shocking to realize that only 28 of american
i will not forget today we got that text message u
texting has a 100 open rate
he told me not to tell anyone
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one the natural text message that we receive
it's my dad
and so is that day that we decided that we needed to build a pricest tech hot line
he's up here again
i can use it in my company
whatever is about that priston where they were born things like that
you'll reconpe a litle difference right
they supported me all the way through it
that's something we are to celebrain
she got dtter
we're blessed with people who listen to us
something is wrong

and at the other end of this straction would do in an equally c of the job

what about it
i was going through it had kind of it
i'll like what
is only part of the fattery backed up
woman theres coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make a suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
when we do the result of often surprise
i don't fare
wealth is liripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproducted
they don't represent what our views are
we had the battle between jefferson and camelton
this economy won't work and thomas jeffersdon's saying that people won't trush that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all the
but that if' had tons of problems

so why don't we leverage that
to be levers the cloud

i'm talking about future
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time in the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was the only way to get anything done
efficiency is forour robots
human relationship and not efficiions

but now it can turn around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't ght
without it we mitally can't interface with others
my desire to disappearan is still very powerful
and it is important
we can only think of one way
we are talking about the nds in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless you find a way to globalize democracy or
for any national leader
you wouldn't like the anscer
they were arguing with one another about access to the ho resytl
the supreme for has fallen way down from what it's used to bee
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing a new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have a
it will be invisible catpacity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first ten people to have this surgery

he saw written down some me
that's the state of the art
and now we want to do a double douveble of the age wave coming through
and so they took them to some sake place
i understand how this could happen
and in fact what dould happen to my brain
we now have a platform
and my whole world did open up
and he does that furamishes
i'm a professor're passionate about education
we bought one of these

it was like a start you know
that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
re is decentralized data daye that has the same exfficiency theonopolies
weould see everything in thekipedia
is the composit view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is that posible
thenveryron it fopact we don't have comedy relief
they have that idea
then she gets the bosses to create h creative and innovative they arew
i'm optate
so people hear about this study and i're like great if i want to getid of my job i just need to uprade my broters
they know you can fail by starting a business to go thank up or by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winner has ces from a different tibal group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need a survey
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i couldn't share myself away from the cooard
african americans supported it at a higher level than have ever been reported
and others presented this comparisone lif civil life and
we are looking for something morew
i do like magic
will you just have to find another tern and look that up
to me it's not that peer
that may not always the case
we can't change own minds
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard charrises
i got about 3000 mmiles
my own website
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much potential
it's about chving who you are and what you can do
brought and young w men
and i look back home and i said that iea i don't know who i am
and this ischool
no one onland had any idea that anything has gone wrong
he board the plane
the engine fails
this plane take f5
they dreamed of a variety of horrifying scenario
so no back doors
how do you get to build those relationships
you just had a new thing s
so we created a new fh
and boy they were like what
but that is the name that we can't
ow that's a very very good point
we were wrong
we have to decide what it means
but this is why i heard from a lot of outrea people
the answer was no
thinking how stuff is made memorable
and i got pretting into it
back you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was samous for sculpture
now i know why i am here
for get whri
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of comm am i talking about here
for hepatitis it is also t2 and a half times
children are especially cenitive to this reouteated death activation
imagin you' walking in the forest and youk a bu
and that's puymazing
but eventually they did come outnd
you are here in a stony vill
and so it quicket for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized sk
they're not donated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just seuch expression
there's no other ways
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience and it relate cementor
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral cend that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a cwicest thats getting worth day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters that the new productor service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
ok when we could make a mobileag account
you can get volunteers
you drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you a couple ofr
imagine if we have across the country right now in mulotor places that
i have passion in my heart
it's different wie
bous can bring the imagination to life and ways that wemind us that all of our bonds in the es
i can stand up and do something
brozen not yet
had to call here in movement
look at these predious structures
their feces froadcast theirjects
building haandy like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will pay dividends
and in many cases you don't
but we all fit
dan replies so often you won't even notice
that wasn't case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no more charge before you
and then something falls off the wall
i can hard the way
only 1 of the people actually farmers
's de finers
so what do you do

why are you really good
and i cried
i hadn't bathed in three days
i was winning award

i defin i'm doing it right now i
do i fustier
i study shame
why is you seeing us up
he said yeann
and here's what you need to know
at what point did i think that was a good idea
have you lost your mind
i made a mistake
if the bestays shut people down the airplane
you asked what do women need to be to confm a female more
you shouldn't have been athnalistic
it is a self shilling prophety
you don't know out how comput this works
people for everybody to learn how to dead and wait
he wanted to kee fr
and you really look at how wes it that young people spend mootst of their times you can be technologies
what is it for the meice
the when we got out of the army and had tremendouscchological problems when they got home
how does that work
that's what so complicated about was
it's not what i had expected
is incredibly hot
before you out there for eight years
you have to answer thate
they're too busy putting out a deaily fire to think ahead ofutially
and they don't use aspermissions
that's my question
what this iy talking about
let me illustrate this
this is completely gu
that's a terrible waste of time
you get only if you're paid by the hours
now is only different
that would not work
you your motcocous
it is the default option
and you walk around and it points the things
you just move awayg
now hamiliton was everything madatison was not
firstly found a political parties
and they did it in a good old passion way
they change from persons to person
so it's more about kepturing an idea than about kepturing the moment
she was doing of her
that was perfect
sh you mind about her wife
and 75 of them are women and ch
she dies and she course networks
now my own specialityy combines the digs of technology is math
for' becoming the thin aact of a new language

a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people seend more on lrinkingat or sociat that people
young people in the world

thank you very much
so theyout saos to come there
ater you watch together
that's your grands formo
you didn't understand the program

they were all height
and more like about
and that's hld
i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies they're fully capable of covering this
this is possible
even when it is so hot
that's what happened with my dad
with the candim mou
they get scared to walk around
my dad and has alzheimer's to dore
'm try to fel a better person
and what i need now is the mn to do like that
they want to be
and the problem we're solving is what are those things
so m with you
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i know platfmes i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young at
a digital world farm
what would that change the quality of life the nutritions
why didon't you just tell me that
what can i worry with you
can you find the gold
so that was easy
and the way to do it is throu the bloodst
we werent considered the real thing
so we need the solution and these people play again they are showing us
so that's it for now
that's alo right
and one act of this actually gou a contract from a western company to the sale of surveillance
just in sie of
i would terrify
the same tool that united us to couple dictators
thatet's not to say it's impossible
growing up i was always intstrued by how people's change
again lets just praase
i don't lk differena
that think can probably happen every day
now i'm mady for my ima here
i needed an education
did i get my uprace
we must adopt that way you're giving back
and i'm like ford
i was want to with you
he's five years old
and i thought one am my fisking
it's not one late
and that's what i'm palling for here now
so you want to go to that board meeter but you only want to pay attention to the bix of intereurst
but what do you do
he only thing heal ourselves
and this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
but robot cid on a great show
we can ma more and more
he the same thing is wor
and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that we' are taking before something
and pid ness
we were so excited
the greable people are warn and friendly nfe with life
n san surrounda by a bunch of snakesy chars
the end of that question is very definittive
attention ford others
it's all about what can us do for me
whereas sitting picking a more of you your inner moted you
and he said well i just care so jepar about my customers that i would never sell them one of our craashy products
and when we think about it it makes a lot of sense because form  a question is a really complex
let's think about your ethical footprint
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
he's had a technology conference in slida
or what do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably wotk
we have to fix the internet
most of the pen media were shut down
now dont it me then
of course they did
i could make that decision
that's not een imposbible
if you know about number
you can navigate sae
you saw him matx
maye me feel smart
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
i don't even know that the real job title to be honest
the coldest i've ever been
