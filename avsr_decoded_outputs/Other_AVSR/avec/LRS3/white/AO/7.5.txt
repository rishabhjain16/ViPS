they want to be part of it
and they say i w working global poverty but what will it mean about my career
i don't know
i'm a doctor
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
and i don't have to do anything
so i looked for furniture
we why is that
what differences that make it they talkoryig cell
what different fooors make
now i will maintain them
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is good
the boys reminded me of home
it wasn't like them to mispractice
1cent you get to do that
i didn't want to
i said in arabic
after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
theyaen hit the jack hot
look at the enders to the animal
i'm in the prucial right now
what is the abstract se
you don't question that
it's so obvious
and they put on an off they all night long
that's what neves you
i know you understand that
i have an idea for saving the world
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
it's kind of the anti reality cg
and it' s hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
nobody comes to get famous
how are we going to do that
so naturally i asked what is affricut
and it doesn't
it took six days to deploy a global malwa campaign
it should be inspiring
how do you know for sure
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
that is not simply critical floresom
and had to remember we had experience with this
in other words a corner to find these things to because this is a fatal effice
what can we do in all of us
roughly 300 savings and londs involved roughly 600 senior piciants
what do we need to do
thank you very much
and he surprised me by saying you know what
so i am going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
patriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the facts that i'm the survivor of all forms of sexual views including three
and guess what silicon valley
i tried engaging people
and they also knew that they could happen to a workforce
i don't know
but people did not relate to this
people starty contributing idea
and that s actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
wh there's no structure
out tog diner with family
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
we do train them however to adjust paution according to where they are
he wanted to sit where he could s stand the room where he could plan a stake rouout wh he could get his hand
and that's exactly what that is
you rememer call us
you need to be able to do something with it
we are always trying to make it faster
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to the fi
there's no more oth it
so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
we payid two to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equations
sustainability has got to be a precompetitivevicsion
even if we get everybody's working on it we've got to be strategic
so was mother tersa
we that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have an overfe
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
trust is the response
because it's given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve croass
you don't get the same witnesses or devositions
again in a car
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shames
i was petrified
not a lot of hands
and when she went to complain to a major she said what
seual rearasment doesn't discriminate
f just stuiss
say all look the same whather m i mean to your first apoxumimation
well i think about this all the time
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
it's just not possible
and theirs has progressed
and it is happening every day
they're looking and looking and finding large
how why you
i think this was a problem
set as jies in boston
but it's more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own peace
like why did i really have to mo along
and if not that they didn't want me to critically
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
you'll never walk again
so let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
and you're broken your back
the keia really a knowledge
these guys could be true to their purpose which is finding o than gas
we need to be part of a community to survive
isn't about a quality
we all know de inside what the answer is
we've beenown since we were babies
i started looking at them really carefully
is it about systems
i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decisions
and they were basically having fun
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous first
so we lost ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what found us together
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its poor values are
especially when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also train our brain to chewe out when somebody else's issues
this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they weregain freushing poverty widing
well very often we think about political change in defines whowo partners who thingays
so i want to talk to you today about when i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
a couple of years ago a group of us think canada decided that we were hitting the limit of what we could accomplish
so that's what i'm doing
we're not just far of the same species
we're part of the same family
i have free thuns and i see how they fight
and i won't nam names but you know who you are
we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
we've all done this
when it's 10 degrees fllow  eero
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive joes of chemotherapies
and she suffered so much
is love and their friendships and their protection
could we merge
the question why does she stay
which is why that i doleve degree and the wall stery jobs and h great shiny future
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love of psychological traf disguised with love one
he kept one in the glov compartment of our cars
and here's where those guns canment
i had just graduated from harvard college
show of used the lie of day by talking about it with your children your cow workers your friends and
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
and all of that sounds greek until you figure out where it's really going
and when we are unprepared we overreacted
they're not my children
and i did not know what to sake
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learned to calculate locate
on the other hand statistics its a subject that you could and should use
so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
and then at 11'clock they stopped talking about these issues
you can try it
everything in the universe wears out
and that blew my mind
how fool is that
that's nothing special
again it had no choice
it had no choice
i realize course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last thing you want to do
you don't get a chance to mess it up
one of them got caued up in the water
my mother was on the line tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
and i thought we should just stay home
so we decided to go to the mosque
i feel that god knows you
he wrote that
i tagged along with my neighbors
i me you goir
and i said to myself i want to get one of them
i feel guilty sometimes
you want to work for him
boy it matt of a lot
he said what you need
he hadid grek value
so i'm not saying that saying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
the job needs to be challenging
the science is that
d da drive better decisions
there's going to be a new system based on donated practic tracking technologies from the logistic company that i work for
but we're not there yet
you see there's a lot of things you just don't have data on
with that you can actually trigger aid fundings the forr crisis can happen
it's the win all around
it's the coming of age to bringing data into these manitarian world
and that's a big deal for a profession thatsen hi demand
some germany in france
surely we know enough
four times the massive the sum
you have to get quiet
you haven't earn this
how can we do it
there's a flip side as well
it's shocking to realize that only 28 of american
i will not forget theday we got that text message
texting has a 100 open race
he told me not to tell anyone
i think it might be a lifeline
that last one's an actual text message that we received
it's my dad
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hot lines
who's up the again
i can use it in my company
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
you reckon fiy little differenes right
they supported me all the way through it
that's something we have to celebrate
she goten better
we've less with people who listen to us
something is wrong
the nazis invaded the netherlands
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't work anymore
we'd love to help
locks have names
we have no suspect
we took candon off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
i ran a campon puise department becauseook ins that
and all of this matters great because it pub saking to me is the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
so i decided to focus on you the data and analytic to help make the most critical decisions
and at the off other end of the spreectum we're doing an equally terrible job
the impacts legencing
and 67 of people come back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug spaces on the streets just around the corner from our office to turn it
it impacts crime and violence
some people call it dad a science
and one of them said we had a robi two weeks ago
and they would take a yellow sticky and they would wait something on it and they would put it up on a bar
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came actually looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
we have no subects
now at that time handon new jersey was the most angeror city in america
and when i talk to judies around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
youl like the baseball steps 20 years ago
it impacts everything
it worked for the open aid and it worked in the state of new jersey
they're just waiting for their gaying for
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
and ent0 caleroms of
and we connected o a really small thing like the fact that i love country music which is really
this is not a potal profile for your facebook
what about you
i was going through a hard time a life
i was like what
this is the only part the fattery backed up
womans das coming up
which brings me to my second point
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
and when we do the results will often surprise
i don't care
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
they don't represent what our vews are
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilthire
this economy won't work and thomas jeffersons saying that people won't trust that
and nothing happened at all
but that is not the case at all
but that system has tons of problems
so i'm in the media
but you think the government should redistribute
and so we need to do better at copying their nationural environment to get them to thrive
what makes the heart unique
i want to do the center of potential
why is it not working
this is what i'm sucsting naturally be able to do
did you share he has gone madh
thank you very much
why not just let businesses compete
and then i thought there got to be a better way
well that's exciting
we will not be there
what it's hard
that's just st not a quo today
they can't get what they need when they need it
aga just six people
but the water stay there forever
he quite the obvitate
and then guess what
and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
so why don't we leverage that
could be leverage the cloud
we that's the pas
we need portable health benefits
how should we work
is about earning as much as you possibly can
how should we live
we need to reinvent labor organize it
i would never want to do that
take a look at these
and we don't know that it's a homeless shultter
you don't have to bring any corders because the washer and dire are free
sort of leadership by humiliation
he said where is he now
thanks for askin
and they are not just focused on money
it's a performance venue
we of magic
but it's not enough
i am built a career
thank you very much
do you fell money
we would a coler of that
but when i was little i remember he would kill lives in our house with my bevy guns
so to summarize if we could offer a tok quality education to everyone around the world for free
so i didn't gover there while
we can open up city hall
i love building robots
what about manipulations
so that's mobile manipulation
and he wanted one so bppy
she can't identify with that purrent
that didn't happen to me
it made you go wet
it makeould go away
make it go there
thank you very much
and fow like teaching them how to ride a bike
but here's the thing
i don't know
and that's bad
it was a poem
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
my parents came from germanyies
she never wanted to tell me
some of them were really afraid of conpagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of us
so what was i going to do
that is the right answer
constant dat arere notly
i' how old are you
are they potential made
are the attractive
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
when you a thick m d to do that
so i changed my immediate goal to 10000 facs
what makes technology useful and usable
we have to turn that around
and that led me to this project
i became a psychology researcher and i devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
the w the church as often as i could
how do they operate
why are we invented social networks
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
is how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
so we have these kees and samon cycles
so what do you think happens to these gls
once again women get the antrogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
and in fact it probably won't
we've done the research
they are often not recognized at home
women are worth it
mortality is not going down it's goowing up
he had to impersonate a man
so thank you for your attention
it' told its about hormone re placement therapy
and not enough of being done about this
i not sure what it was
and we would like to think it's not going to take 35 years
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy this is about building goods and products and now we have a service
you would be interering ordered from a above
but in fact they found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
this is a real mystery
it was also the first pesson to call me a feminist
my brothers are not as interested as i am
he could come over and help me
how do you change your behaviors
even that wasn't enou
some good not everybody
she wanted to crein polity at the government level
w they eat these cows
it's not a lunchure
it's not octtual
they're nothing shift that theer
and what was the result of that
and that's why it's been to pleasure speaky to you
but it's not just china
where are the philosophers
we suspended our values
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just the iraq in afghanistans
i do believe we can fix what's broken
we all want to
he got hard time ic
i forgive you and i do not hate you
but we only get one history that' the one that we have
how do you find a dinosaur
but this particular reality is not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological record
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
i'm talking about teachers
how would i know what i was doing differently
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
art is not efficient
that was not only way to get anything done
efficiency is for robots
human relationships are not efficient
that's the billibble right now
that is some deep deep emotion when you want to do that
we have no control of these forortes
have inspired a generation of innovators
so it's really important that you know that right now you have over
she never had to d and cover under her desk at school
but it's also an important date for another reasons
so but before that cooperation to de realize kennedy was assassinated and that forur of the
maybe i didn't experiment on myself without just annoying it
i tried everything
it's not exactly rocket slan
wholl pick up the keys
i actually have no idea why
i didn't talk to them
i am pushing and fulling with this object
my research team and i went to west point military academy
that's the work that stands beforest
it's an unconscious process
it's an automatic projess
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
i have resources
in fact is more like 5 percent
and we finally figured out how to do it
i don't have any inter
sometimes it goes further
they have social media
strangers might ask each other forirst tip of water
they were unexpected pleasures
or where she left
how much can you change
so when we met chuck with a senior in high school
the question for us knowledge how much can we make of it
not a single one
i will be back
it's the war on herror
but i love it for a totally different reasation
they make sense of the patt
but it wasn't just in the bidro
what a contradiction
but it's different
it is not a put down of anyone
it is irresponsible
it is wong
are we frave enough to welcome it
started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
they need support
we had law enforcem in pugs
so they won't go for a whotk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
it pracks open my world
his name is wonnehod and he is the veteran of vietnam
he would hide in the closet
they want to know how much experhise your dog is getting
they want to know how often the dog gets outside
are you losing your mind
so ls what's what happens
i'm not a social problem that
so what happens next
i want to worry you about what you're about to go through
why we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
he also had 11 children
not the wife not the kids
he should not have been surprised
please look at me
so no more messsing gaaser
that option is actually not on the table
so it's up to us
but i would go in on occasion
and this routine went on for some times
and now i love my ps
most my fends are taking japanese
i was always very small
i know nothing
so water is something that scared me the beginning
so i thought why not punish myself
and this became my whole dream i was at a stemp
i tried everything
and i thought this should be great fun
i'm in tohsonn
why was it madze
it's a fucking audye
they feel at home
how is it made
nak it about the other partnies
why don't we discodver this anymore
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate in our settled civilizations
imagine juggling a snowball across the conficce
indeed we run the risk of making things worse
we are seeing the baby brain
there were others like myself who were full times
and he's a bad guy
the children were killed on the spot
it's not a dirty word
but those surveillance features come at a costs
government officials are extremely mad
i have to take a year off
i exist because i have my women friends
and guess what
i don't know about you
they grow crps
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman
and this is crazy
i just disagree with that
i want to go
every kid lives near nature
there's colonian going on
there's people everywhere
like we involved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
i was like oh the ima bon
and i'm sure the figures are s more other
you've just someow forgotten how to see it
the vritual worth millnd
how did i come from a nation
what kind of rituals are they
one billion people
it's the magnitude the follm is something you need to appreciate
i know it worked
but i'm not happy
so i went to my daughter
is it that i write very well
you might get in peace for that
let's start d
i want to know how they impact me
i want to know how i impact thema
lots of money
this is a great
it's the top predator
i'm going to be so healthy
's 4 the local economies
i made more money
we' seeed an image of our blue plants or a world banks
i love red one
we don't even need that a plant to be amazing things
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over for basement she found
why you care
so how do we do that
you say you're working more than 60 hours
that's like finding an extra hour in a day
but you can write it
and that's even if he're working way more than full time hours
how eltse can you create ne ideas
china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
but some of our grandchildren probably will
it's natural connected tissues
can we really scale this up
then they have to bring them in
but you know what the actual facts are
but now it's turned around
i take it to therapy
my history wasn't right
without it we literally can't interface with others
my desire to disappear is still very powerful
and it is important
we can only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
for any national leader
he wouldn't like the anscer
they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
the supreme ford has fallen way down from what it's used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they are doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing new potential for innovation for development
but the question is who will have this
there will be invisible catassity
of course migration will become even more important
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of first ten people to have this surgery
onlce we have stem cells
and when i was pen0 i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
why did my child de bela arutism
that is tarrifble
wake a hand
it's actually not that hard
we lost valuable data
that was a huge problem at the hai earthlace
it's about the data
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on biy from the ground to the carr self
and we couldn't just turn it off
it came from the way in which beijing has grown as theici
you're in there
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the transformation the climate transformations we have to decide to do
and looking at that pattern
he saw it written down to me
that's sort of the state of the art
and now we want to do a double double of the age wave of coming through
and so they took them to some take place
i understand how this could happen
and i thouk whatsid happen to my brain
we now have a platform
and my whole world did open up
and he does that finishes
i'm a professor and who a passionate about education
we bought one of these
come on man
but there's actually more to the stories than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how the molecules are put together
effectively the taliban creat a complete blackout of any other source of information
their parents are so forarth they have no resources to get them back
if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimendic
does any of this matter
i'm not a military rat
one was to be a soldier
they signed it because they wanted some form of thends
the other was be a baseball player
but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
prettyool
we have the plan
i am thinking that they love for me
paingrins through my body with the fires of my love fum
i am torn by your love to me
remember what i said my lof
and i said i don't know
i remember what you said to me
who might say then well let's not worry about this
i mean at some point it's going to be your problem to
how does it happen
it was like a star trek
and that leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
scree a dec centralized data dase that has the same efficiency a monopoly
we can see everything on wikipedia
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
and how is that possible
so going me wrong' look like if we don't have comedy in the leaf
they have that ideas
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
i'm the opposite
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get beet at my job i just need to upgrade my brows
they know you can fail by starting a business that go bankrpt or by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winter has come from a different tribal group
they have to be able to teach us something as well
and in that i need a surgery accent
and this wasn't just an abstract question
i couldn't tear myself away from the coverage
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been reported
and others presented this comparison between the rights civil rights and
we are looking for something more
i do like magic
will you just have to find another term and look that up
to me it's not that clear
that may not always be the case
we can change our minds
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard charragers
i got about 3000 emils
s my own website
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much potential
it's about moving who you are and what you can do
brought in young w men
and i went back home and i said dadzyea i don't know who i am
and if was true
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
you board the plane
the engine fails
the plane takes off
they dreamed of a variety of horrifying scenarios
there were no back doors
how do you get to build those relationships
you just had a dow thing sometimes
so we created a newchoolce
and boy they were like what
but that doesn't mean that we can't
ow that's a very very good point
we were wrong
we have to defide what it means
but this is what i heard from a lot of outrage people
the answer was no
this is how stuff is made memorable
and i got pretty into it
you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
now i know why i am here
we guess what
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of tram am i talking about here
for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bar
and that's pretty amazing
but eventually they did come around
you are healer in a stoneyge village
and so it's put it for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
for not jonated
and use is what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
there's no other way
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience as itlate cementering
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis that's getting worth day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new productor service is
we don't have enough money
and we all know this
ok then we could make a mobile geiger counter
you can get volunteers
you can drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you a couple of you
imagine if we had across the country right now multple places that
i have passion in my heart
it's just a wal
those of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
i can stand up and do something
well not yet
has a coherent movement
look at these pred structures
their faces broadcast their experience
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that will change everything when we see that
this will pay dividends
and in many cases we don't
but we all should
dan replies so often you won't even notice that
that wasn't the case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no more charge before use
and then something falls off the wall
i can hardly wve
only one per of the people who are actually farmers
talk to farmers
so what can we do
heres the up fall new
they don't get your money out
thins my child
she worked in a bank
i believe a the story there has to be told
i have to record it
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
he was smiling and we said go
we've been working together sin lking for your kids really
which brought us to this
you don't do much shouting
it wasn't who i was
here's where i sit
they don't have meaning
the change the way we taught
a new idea
the bodgp
why don't they cuss them off
they don't trust along
on the dad ses
we don't usse obis we don't usoose videooss
so what to do next
but i need your help
what is that
she contacted anyone and everyone who is willing to buy my work
give me in forut
there's nothing underground about it
it's right there for you to find
we only sell you airtype
which means take my camera
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
and he thinks i'm saying take my pictures
things would going well
why are we skipping over this
this is a really important chapa to me
i wanter toaay this relationship
i went to the deans
you're doing incredibly important work
and so many of my early memories involve intricate daydreams where i walk across borders
one year i came up with a bright idea
we can do this
i'm so sorry
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the words
you made it work for me
we know why kids don't learn
there's no need to play the market
i look at sladves
it's not a lot of money at the global level
how could everpen down
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
it's always what it was and what it can be
let us have a hong kong nearby
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
i tried everything
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
i wasn't very good at reading things
we're on the grid
thank you very much
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scared for the helpless
there w't be a single moment in the schedule
i don't paint
we're going to become really frea and obvious
so how does this work
we change the economics for the bad guys
again it will not happen overnight
i mean everyone did
it needs to happ it
is it heavy
we let other people worry about it
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
where would it go
you can experience their sense of place
who would i meed
shid i go there
the whole internet
i was looking for this thing that only fool seemed to look for
you can walk around them
you are all collected
what is an idea dray
and particly'll tell you what's the jokees
here and one person causes to you
we just need to keep going
we don't even more as lawic continue
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence
and we have problems that we desperately need to solve
three billion people today the cell phes can't ac at internet
don't create solutions to imfresh customers
so what did he do
why is it important now
and not just that
they met together
he was talking about the importance of coaching voys and com men and changing the culture of the loftter room and giving
and let me just put this in context
and you know what else you did
and that's what we did
we met men where they were at and we built a program
why do i believe that
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of our flghts
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still missing a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
this is your chas
which incin alome is only a third correct
i don't mean giving up the internet
it is my belief that you create these rare game changes requires you to fall off at least
on you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
don't you get several things
so they added oxygen to methane gas
we guasess that they use at first in many cases with oxygen
and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
that's what we do
you were born to
of those seven have nuclear weapons
but it's a global phenomenon
just think about it
it's very hard to get up forrse
we're going to stay with them forever
and that interestation is beautiful
and does it matter
i was thought of b an interaction design
design is aspired to be really great designers
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
it's like once again there is the full problem of design being aten and the food for art
what we want what we fire to leave the cold
i don't understand
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
go i sat again swep forming on my brow
for africans homegoown science fiction can be a will to power
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writings
i had no idea what i was going to do with it get't worse
it is in the water
it was faulty and most of the time i had to restarted over and over before it worked
it's a marker of interatfid
casual speech is something quite different
any spoken language view by real people have them
textings has developed ones from this flash
that's what texting is
and so how does your brain give you that detail
i know i have
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
if using pass experience based on similar situations to try to make things
i'm toolly seriou
not what it it
they are the basis of every action that you take
so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
well that's what predictions are
terrorists are doing this
think about that
of course we are going to go even deeper than the human body
when in the history of humanity has ever been possible for one person to rob one
they also monitor the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we' are going down to the cellular level these days
i struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
what if i had told them my story years ago
after all i was a bit unconventional
they have different interests
but it's not about fire in gwindstone either
it means for youth and it's a new arab of tv channel
there is an animated series in the works
and she's looking as young as ever
they have divergent values
throu are nouional cameras
the economy needs them
i wanted to understand who takes the job
full cleans of ater us
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
so i started a research project within
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
and this leadks to audities
but this is the source of innovation
if we' are still hungry we might have the more
we're not playing with each other
there's a lert ways to eat piza
but if you wonantt move we'll have no choice but to run you down
i went to extreme length to try to be straight
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
i see now i never was one and not the other
i will not be praaed
one woman leaves her head
face with absence
one woman feeds on trash
my fine curd spiral
one woman give birth to borders
i will classh my own drumg
thickness health gnder violence
i loo cycles of light in darkness
one woman straps herself
where do refugee hearts go
c the bombs left behind
one woman never did
we marn women complicated
one woman sheets her faith
harvest contaminated to backoes
rhythm is halh silence
one woman gives birth to her baby
want to ask all of the faith to do that instead
my father works at this fashy hs
my grandfather work h disfactories
and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
that even small scale farmers can leverage
it is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
it's about people
the net outcomes
china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
we just need to act on it
nll i didn't have any idea
it would be a mall and not of part
i had to have faith
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
how is that possible
they want e treatment
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
we are all responsible
but that's kind of a big problem
so after 25 years i began to feel asthough i was running dray
like they'll say in them forever
how do i get through the hardest part
so momentum is good
and then what happens
often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part
n not how much
or a firefly
please sign hes right now
it goes wrong
and it is powerful
why does the jellyfishion in at life
it's more annoyinged
last week alone i got 238 piecers of naske email and more
but i'm a big fan of you as a person
that's more as speciive

what are the researchers learning
and now i didn't
so i'm jealous
i like thinkive me n only person
and i alay reven sared
but i found one
the ially is so obvious right
that's next to impossible
so i went in ma direction
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
what is dying for
i didn't know where i was
these is a social category that have staggering biological consequences
i'm also on this mission because the way doctor's practice medicine continues to
and this idea is actually nothing news
one way around this is to draw pictures
i start it op in uganda
thank you for your time
i'll let you continue
you have the bias
if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
well that's what i thought
harness your internal strength
we know that we are right may are wrong
we have to throw it away
how can we get so much information out of so little motion
we push and pool and poke and bob thems we
you would just get noise back
how satter are you right now
originally the sample was aged 18 to 94
we take less notice of trivial matters
how frustrated are you right now
we know that every cell has effects
but linda was lucky
we have the tool but we lack the collective will and momentum
but for too many women that's not the case
she found us we found her disease
the authors looked at papers written over a 1en year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
it showed no blockages
and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
and then we were alarm to discover something
as an inventor i try and turn fantasy into realities
that when you get long caneniser
no flankton miss no fish
and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
' actually studied hormones
and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplant
we can't see it most of the time
did you learn to wash your hands at home
so why is it
did you learn to wash your hands in school
why aren't people wasathing their haads
1836 people died

what about martin luther king
in fact south africa has not gone down that road
my life really suck
life is great
it' the group gels
but we're not done yet
and you don't leave them where they are
all of you are members of tries

there was no road mapin
but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
you don't want this
i
i don't know anybody
and he grew up essentially in stage one
it comes out of a place called the gallu organizations
you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people to try about how
if you want this experience to live on as something historic then it's of perception
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
let's come b
we don't trust them in
i do understand
means were stood up before
which is debate about words about metaphors
i don't know
you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
it doesn't happen very much
it has to stop
what about homeo
i d' know what
it brings people together and it supports creativity and social prooheses
they were right
they had her scanned inside out
we're losing a ritual
i teach at stanford
i would listen to the heart
this was when i was in texas
' a physician practicing with cutting edge technology
often i felt all this
so i learned never to move
it would skip a bee
it would stop
it would start
we can do it again
and it's just really a pmision
when you go up forr you want to be rich
getting a college education is a 20 year investment
now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
storytelling is so important
so what guys
what would happen
it's albs are amazing
we that wasn't you asked
what if obesity isn't pause of inflin resistance at all
got unlucky
but you know what
but you know what
how far away was the finish line
i am fascinated by those times when people do not be eye to eye
so this is not the slogan from an inspirational postper
otherw5e millions more will die
i even read and hell help books
i will not be hearing this
the first lesson is about theumillity
fight and let me know how it worth to us
m right now
i am certainly not hardest working
i was the first non family investor in amazona
it has never happened
i was a mediore student
this is noto expse
this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab reegion
but i grew up in canada far from my arab roreots
social change doesn't happen in the arab region throu dramatic confrontations
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
about a year after 9 11 research who examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were those to the world
my other great passion is the environment
so let's get started now
i was considered a radical
i was living in my own apartment
i was no longer homeless
i did't i succeed
why are you really here
and i cried
i hadn't bathed in three days
i was winning awards
would you like to create a second one together
it's been thought about for a while
well i was surprised
i did not know this
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such brazen
some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break the girls
i am full of contradictions
i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
i enjoy fashion magaisines and pretty things
they are gorgeous and headstrong vriiot girls who are a whole lot of brave
he has the right to his best
i want no part of any of that
i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given women feminisms
it really is quite phenomenal
who or what inspired you and why
that's different from actually having an effective accion
5 percent days
how's that possible
that is great
thank you very much
how much do you
what do they have
do they have a common coal
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
that they have age
you make it flow under and over
i'm a fifth generation teestans
what do you do
i guess i'm doing it right now
your wife lust you
i study shame
why is you doing this up
she cid yianna
and here's what you need to know
at what point did i think that was a good idea
have you lost your mind
i made a mistake
it's the best way to shut people down on the airplane
he asked what do women need to do to conform a female norms
you shouldn't be nationalistic
well this is self sfilling processy
you lon't know about how computers works
but if you p for everybody to learn how to read andvrite it
hee wanted to keep four
when you really look at how we it that young people spend most of their time you can do technologies
what is it that e mxic
some woman got out of the army and had tremendsychological problems andn they got home
how does that work
that's what so complicated about war
it's not what i had expected
is incredibly hot
the boys arere out there for a years
we have to answer that
they're too busy putting out a daily fire to think ahead strategically
and they don't need to ask formissions
that's my question
was this guy talking about
let me illustrate this
this is completely design
that's a terrible waste of time
you get only if you are paid by the hour
now do just someth different that
that would not work
you're more cautious
it is the default option
and you walk around and it points the things
you just move away
now hamilton was everything madison was notge
first they found it political parties
and they did it in the good old fashioned way
they change from persons to person
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing the moment it
she was douing ok
that was perfectle
sh you mind about her rights
and 75 of them are women and chre
she dies and supporse networks
my own specialityies is combining digital technology and magic
it's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
it turns out the evidence goes otherwise
it's a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
young people as were
let's help them have thels
and that's what we did
all we heear too as
the silent majority does not need to do silent
we shar the chaos of wall
thank you very much
so they felt safe to come there
i did we worked together
that's your grandsfather
we didn't understand the program
tell me that that
they were all fight
and more like a bld
and that's old
i mean never go to your house you mll never come to my house
they were wonderful people
the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this for
this is possible
even when it is so hard
that's what happened with my dad
they get scared to move
they get scared to walk around
my dad has alzheimer's disease
you' trying to become a better person
and what i need now is to learn to do like that
they won the game
and the problem worth so allving is what are those things
so bear with you
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i knowl ones i knowo computers they've put me on the internet when i was young i
a digital world farm
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
why didn't you just tell me that
what can i learn with you
did you find the gold
so that was easy
and the way to do it is through the bloodstrein
we weren't considered the real thing
so we need the solution and these people playing the game they are fowing out
so that's it for now
that's also right
and one activist actually got a contract from a western company to the sale of surveillance
it's just incredible
i was terrified
the same tools that united us to couple dictators
that's not to sa if it's impossible
growing up i was always intrigued by how people change
again let's just phase
i don't lve diffena
thatsen can probably happen every day
now i'm ready for my inage year
i needed an education
did i get my upgrade
we must adoppt that way of giving thatack
i'm not sure
i was like to li with you
he's five years old
and i thought what am i thinking
it's not one wa
and that's what i'm calling for here now
so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bitsit interest
so what do we do
the onlystl feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we cannect more and more
do the same thing it worth
and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that we' are taking before something
we said yes
we were so excited
the agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
they' say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
the answer to that question is very definitive
what are you your attention toward others
it's all about what can use you for me
whereas giving and taking a more of your innermotves or your value
and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our craffhy products
and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming of question is a really complex
let's think about your ethical footfrints
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
he's had a technology conference in florida
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably won't
we have to fix the internet
most independent media was shut down
now won't get me wrong
of course they weould
i could make that decision
that's not an impropable cp
if you know about number
we can navigate space
you saw him that
it made me feel smart
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
is the coldest i've ever been
