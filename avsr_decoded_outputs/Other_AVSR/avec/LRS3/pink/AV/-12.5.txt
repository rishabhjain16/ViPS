progressive movement are growing and resist tremendous courage
so we lock ourselves in the room and we try to figure out what' about together
ll we rejected all of that
we looks like what it fels like and most of what value
especially when it comes to climate
but in the process they allso train our brain down what somebody else do
the movement depending change what crhing poverty one
were very often we think about political change de fin partment

there's a flip tinest way
chuck to realize that only 28 aic
and we'll not forget the day we got the text message
is 100 open
he told me notarly one
i think it might be life like
that actual dx message that we received
it's my dad
and so was that day that we decided we need to be crazy like
nothing event
i'm doing
reallyed about the way they we p
tible difference tra

we have no s batce
we shh came off the top of most interested amican
i rerad the name to police department
and all of this matters are crazy we' probablya the most important function of
but when you start to look at the data by the way don't have look at the data
so i decided to focus to help decision
at thepot spectrum we doing terrible job
a
and 7 percent of people back
it turned out that we were doing a lot of lo level trre traic order from our office trust
about truma finence
some people call the days
and one of them is said we had grabm twes ago
and they wr them they would po up on the board
haven't been conf of your crime
and i couldn't get this information out
they were unbelievably expensivein they were limited local
and when i look at the criminal systm united i felt that same with of
when i toartedch i found question and i came back
we have no dspect
at that timeam lutr was the most interesting america
