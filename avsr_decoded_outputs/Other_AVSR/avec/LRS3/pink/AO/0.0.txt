and adult to f awayvery s
so i looked for burniture
well why is that
what differen isould make it they c like dury find cell
what different doisions make
now i will make hat that
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of us
life is strens
the boy re minded in a po
it wasn't like them to this practice
1cent you get to do that
i didn' want to
my sid in arov
after college i guessate we needed pind place to call hall

i'm the beaible right now
what is the exra bee
you don't have you mou
it's so obvious
and they put on and off to all my glindnd
that's what needs to
i know you areerstaing that
i have an idea pcading the wall
he are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
kind of anti reality
and it's harded it takes courage that's why we'ill alive frly
nobody comes to get pain them
how are we going to do thatter
so not forg out what is that

it took six days to deploy a rbal smower campaigne
it should be inspiring
i you know before

i amsifed to my stomach
that is not simply pitical s
and i remember we had experience to them
in other words a poner could find each oth a gf lat
what can we do in all
rusghly 300 savings of hs all rroughly 500 stu
what they is
thank you very much
and he surprised me i said you know what
one is say awesome stuff about myself
could allowed me to take the sand of myself
hatriarchy is not boys and men
i started to write about sharing the fact that i survivor of all forms of sexionisms including through
than just one silicon valley
i try engaging people
and they also that they could happen to the work
or' not
but we did not reate for this
people try to to be idea
and that s actually what happens
this isn't information
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
which is no structure
out toginer with familly
but things have changed
but just imagine for a moment what just must feel like
do train them however to adjust aion for int to where they are
we wanted to say we could stand the room and we could plan  sta rout we could get his hand
and that's exactly what that means
you're go to call it
it's beer to do something with it
we're always try to make cartter
at the same time
we're not be able to do that
how do you get informed
so it the demand that brings them to the fa
there is no more of
that we did the analyshent to be in slightly differently
we take two to three times more than anybody else
l go back and tells the verylayation
sustainability has got to be of precompetition
even if we get everybody's working on we've got to be strategent
so was other terrisfic
or that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
i don't have a b
let me give it a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in h life
trust is the response
because it is given by other people
we can do it two people together trying to improve class
youe the same with of your depositions
again in a car
thousands of women started teach ab me to share their own stories of pain and agony and change
i wasould petrified
not a lant of hand
and when she went complained to a major she said what
stualingement doesn't eciminate
they just do it
they allways contain i meed to a first c
i think about that all the time
but now heck up where they go on our tree of life
it just not possible
and their has progress
you happen every day
that looking and looking and finding liar
howy are you
i think this is a problem
that the jovan bathon
thins more compicated
you can't hide behind anything with others than your own key
my why did i really have to know about
it's not that they didn't want me to critically
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
if letting stu happen without thinking about it
you'll never want togain
so let's move on to that thalk for just a minute
it's like a pece of junpnail to be thrown away
and youre broken the back
that hev' really not
you guys could be truth to their purpse to finding more than gu
you need to be part of the community to survive
thin about a our0 people

and they were recently having fun
the breashic movement are growing and resisting with comremendous cur
so we locked ourselves in the room for ting and we tried to figure out and found us together
but we rejected all of them
what it looks like what it looks like it looks like what it's morer values tim
the feally when it comes to climate change
but in the process they also trained our brain to cheat out to somey else's issues
this meant that the movement demanding canage knw within a da prushing povery and wising
well very often you think about political change and defines who parters
so i want to talk to you today that when i think's a much more com reciede for deep
a couple of years ago if were like canada decided that we were hitting the limit of what we could accomplish
so that's what i' doing

how oflten you treatking ideas
china is the world great atentnda pausity program over the last fwo decades
e the two of our grandchildren probably well
it's natural connected tissues
can we really scale this up
then they have to bring them in
if you know what the actral facts are
but now it's curn around
i take it to therep people
my history wasn't wored
without a mniquuly can't interface with others
my desire to disappearing is still very powerful
and it is important
we could only think of one way
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
franess the real world and unless he finds a way to to globalize democracy or
for any national laders
you like cancer
they were arguing with one another about access to h recys
the suprees bod is falling way down to what it used to be
we can create a global parliament of mayors
they were doing it together
a huge opportunity unleashing a new potential for innovation for development
but the question is will havepp
there will be invisible compasitity
of becauserse migration will become even more forced
and this change is getting more rapid
i know i was one of the first 10 people had me fird

we want valuable data
now was a huge problem that can be the eirthplace
it's about the data
i'm enough strong enough to lift my carry on back from the grain to the caraff beell
and you couldn't just turn it off
it came from planguage beijengustros
your ist
we can see how to do that
that's really important
but the second of the chance the climate chans we have to decide
and looking at that pattern
he saw him with he down coin
that's sort of the state of the art
and now we want to do a double double of the age wayve coming through
and so they kept them to sent take place
i to understand how this can happen
and i thought whatould happen to my brain
we now have a platform
and my whole world did open out
and he is that peneit
i'm not a professor're passionate about education
ll we've bought one of the
governmen
but there's actually more tere stories than that
the oil will never run out
what's different is how the molecules we put together
effectively the tharibas create a complete platu of any other forource of information
that therear is are so poar they have no resources to get them d up
if any child is found by lating he mose he is toveren reprimended

'srett fool
we have the plan
i am seeking a the ls for me
painuin through my body with the fires of my bod began
i am torned by your lan
remember what i spaid my life
and i said i don't know
i remember what he said to me
we might day in for lett have play up
i mean at some point it's going to be your problems
how did it happen
who was like a starting you
l leads to a very powerful tool
and that might have been the case
thank you very much
can create the  centralized data dase that has the same efficien to mopo
we can see everything that can be l
it's a composit and constantly changing being updated
and how is that possible
so reveryonant this look like you don't have comany in relief
they have that idea
then she gets the lost the ate how wreated and innovative they are
i'm op
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better of my job and just upgrade my browders
they know you can fail by starting a business so make up more by failing to start a business at all
because each year the winen this comes from a different tibal group
you have to be able to teach something as well
and in that i need a circuus
and this wasn't just an outstrapp bust d
i couldn't care myself away from the cored
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been spported
and others presented this comparison ghts civil rights and
we're looking for something new
i do like magic
you just have to find another turn and look that
to me it's not that here
that may not always be gess
we can change own minds
they're completely plahed and they're basically cardboard characters
i got about 3000 house
you a websites
so since then i've thinam the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
but there's so much ptential
think about moving who you are and what you can do
brought in the younger man
i would bectck from my minde that ya i going to know who i am
and it is fool
no one onland had any idea that anying gone wrong
you board the planes
the engine fails
plane tick off
they dreams of a variety of horrifying menarios
there were no back doors
how do you get to fill those relationships
you just haded music
so we created a newpook
and for they were like what
but that are the name that we can
that's a very irgd point
we go what
we have to defide for the people
but this is what i heard from a lot of countes
the answer was n
how stuff made memories
and i got pretty intoed
back you remember what it was
i had to do something
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
now i know where i am here
for guess why
for depression it was four and a half times
what kind of timm am i talking about here
for hempatitis gw offo to a half tim
children are especially senitive to this rerpeate stef activation
w imagine you're walking in the forest and youk a ban
and that's for an eason
but eventually they d mind
you are here in a stoning village
and so it cquick it for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
they're not heavily subsidized
they're not fail either
and usees what creates impact
because we can
i mean i thought poetry was just some expression
there's no other way
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
so what's women's experience is it the late s mentring
so this is obvious right
we now have a moral sell that is in the tradition of others that we have
this is a crisis that is getting worth day by day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters that the new product re service is
you don't have enough money
and we all know
ok and we can make a mobile daiger dn
he can volunteers
drive around
so thank you very much
let me tell you about a couple
imagine if we had a cross the country right now in multor place
i have passion in my passion
it's just a that
look at them bring the imagination to life and things that we mind us that all of our bonds and
i canould stand up and do something
well not getet
haveas to c here in moutflace
look at thisse pree structure
their feces broadcast their strs
buildings can be like people
why is that hard
that would change everything was to see that
this will peeed the anent
and in many cass you don't
but we all dood
daniflies so often you won't e to notice
that wasn't case for me
we all know what he's talking about
no more card before you

i can hindly wor
only 1 of the people are exually farmers
dok to find it
so what do we do
heares about fal
theyon't get their money out

whats stands relationship
i want you to thin
they do an incredibly important work
and so many of my early memories involved intriced beaings where i was walking across borders
one year i came home with the bright idea
we can do this
hand sul sa
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the world
you made it work for me
know i can st' learn
years maded to play the mortage
i looked at slaves
it's not a lot of money at the glow level
i could ever be that
intends tonessing and it's always unpredicul
soays what it was and what it can be
let us have a hong kong ne tovy
they want to get out
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
i tried to everything

i wasn't very good at reading thse
we're on the grid
thanks very much
so they don't have to rely on people getting scarred with the
we at a single moment in the schedule
i don't pin
it's going to become really freaky ovious
so how does this work
we change the economics to the bad times
again it will not happen on the nay
i mean everyone did
it needs impappen
is it heavy
to be let other people worry about me
was the intern actually a place that you could visit
where would it gone
we can experience their sense of place
who would i mean
can i go there
the whole interment
i was looking for this thing that only fool seem to look for
you can walk around them
ne well collective
and what is an idea joy
and toally ok what to go
here i went this in pouion to you
we just need to keep going
we're l't even more a lot of contine
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the top of parition
and we have problems that we deferitely need to flve
treeving as people sa theyre full haa internet
don't see a sodutions topresh ahution
so what did they do
why is it important more
and not just that
then mat together
and he was tell you about the importance of culachal voice for man who changing the culture their lack and giving
and let me just put this in context
you know what outlse for h
and that's what he did
who metman wh they were not 2y gsen coms
why mi belie that
we were obviously making a difference
take a look at one of our fass
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about dating
we were making what was invisible visible
but we were still nissing at a critical element
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we ask them help us

and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we had to
know it's like once again there the full problem of 9ing often between art
what we want what we inpired tof
i don't understand
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
so i s that again lp warming on my browd

it really is quite phenomenon
to a walk and find youear and wind
that's different from actually having an affected of
55th day
how's that possible
that is great
thank you very much
how much do we do

what do you do
i i'm here at like i
who lies that gill
it shame
why is your doing up
goo yanna
if here's what you need to know
at what point did i think that was a good idea
have you lost your mind
i made a mistake
' the best way you shut people down the airplane
you ask what the women need to be to conport to female the m
i should' be naturalistic
but this is the self sisstillem compethy
you don't work about how computers works
the people for everybody to learning how to readf you
i wanted to keep fr
you can really look at how ars it the young people spend most of their times you can be technology
what is it thatp
and when we got out of the army and had toremend to like the problem and got o
how doid that work

it's not what i had in fection
it incredibly high
was you're out there for a year
we have to answer
they're too busy putting ideally fires to think can have future
and they don't need as pmission
that's my question
with this guy token up
let me illustrate this
it is complete done
the terrible week time
get only if you are paid by the hours
ow someting different that
that would not work
your moncottage
it is the default action
as you walk around and it wts the things

so that is easy
and the way to do it is ste is like str
we wek considered the real thing
so we need the solution and these people play the game they are turining out
so that's it for now
that's w in life
and one actter this actuallyas a contract from a western company to the sale is surveillance
it's just incredible
i w was serfying
the same tool that united them to couple dicators

so what do we do
the only thing to heeel likeselse
when this happens we are not able toppreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
not more and more
do the thinge thing it works

we have to fix our education
he'sot a technology conferences wred
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you probably wked
we have to fix the internet
most of the beviing was shut down
now maake it me that
of course they did
i could make that decision
that's not inen compable
my numbers
it not get safe
