no ones plan had any idea that anythings gone wrong
you board the plane
the engine fails

how do you get to buld for the resear
youll just had to do interest
so we created and those horts
that was who are theyalzed
but that is the mean that we can't
now because that's a veryk i w like to

we now have cated world tell us that is in the tradition of other mempanies that
this is a crisis that getting first dayesi day
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is is that apparently as matters if with the moveh producter service is
we don't haveo monedy
and we all know this
ok we can make a pano maors
you get volunteers
it's not dri around
thank you very much
