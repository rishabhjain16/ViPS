so i looked for for diture
why is that
what difference does it make if they tall like jurics sig valy
we i went different students make them

i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
life is good
the poys re might get me of home
it wasn't like them to misspractice
one perent who getus to do that
i didn't want to

i've tried engaging people
and they also kn that they could tappen to a work force
i don't know
but people didon not rea this
people startedlo beween ideas
and that's actually what happened
this isn't an information
it's super real that's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
there's no structure
how to getin with family

but just imagine for a moment in what did this meci feel like
when you train them however to adjust caution according to rare they are
men' wanted the same way we could stand the room or into the pla as gate prows so we could get as a hand
and that's exactly what that is
youriber call lose
you need to be able to do something with it
we're always trying to make it fashionate
at the same time
we're not going to be able to do that
how can you get informed
so it's the demand that brings them to the teempty
there's no more other
so we did the analations ing in a slightly different way
we' pay 2 to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and this the equation
sustainability has got to be apprinted by theit tue
even if we did that everybodyed we've got depnds to teach it
so what a mother twin
well that's going to be breeding for compassion
i don't have an new of you
let me give you a simple commerciional example
more trust is not an intelligent aiming this life
trust is the response
because it's given by other people
we can do it two people together try to improve just

thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and adding ashame

it's just not possible
and dance has prest
is happening every day
they're looking and looking and fighting love
how w are you
i think this is a problem
but this wasn't wasostingon it
it much more complicated
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
like why did not really have to mot lear
it's nothing they didn't want me the cricly
you can't run around in the dark
what can i do about it
it's letting us stuff happen without thinking about it
you're never waler

it's like a piece of junkman to be thrown away
and you've broken your back
that he here really knowledge
these guys canould be true to their purpose there was rely more than the guys
we need to be part of a community to survive

hownder stand how is going to happen
in fact what'ch the cample into my brain
we now have a platform

we have the right to respect
i want to know part of any of that
i learned to wite them and then i learned to wait as myself
we go far beyond reasonable constructive couiticisstem to dissecting any gien woman's feminism
it really is quite phenomenal
you w walk in spies you and wide
that's different from actually having an infective acpy
5 the day

he asked what old do womenedid doy informed female norms that
we shouldn have been natationalistic
well us is a st a fulfilling profincy
think more about how to can apute this work
but it's just want for everybody h to look that' a reallyd way
why did to keep score
we really look at how re of the young peopleer spend most of their time ne to good technologies
what is it that he mrs
some of them brouot out of the army can had tremendou psychological problems when we got home
how does that work
that's what's so complicated about war
it's not what i had expected
it incredibly high
the boys are up there frontier
we have to hs that
they're too busy putting out daily fires so think they had cregically
and they don't need to ask for permissions
that's my question true
what is this gu talking about
let me illustrate this
this' cple ofs
it's a terrible waste of time
so that only if you' paid body hours
now we should be different now
that we not work
you're most consciously
it is the default option
he walk around and he points to things
not just moveed away
now hamiltin was everything madicine was hotght
versu they've down this political parties
and they did it in the good old fash a way
they changed from personal supporting
so it's more aboutp  an idea that about tapturing com popet tr
she was douing co

75 of them are women and children

it's a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people spent more hund trinking or smoking that people

let's just help them have a voice
and that's what we said

and l's home
i'm never going to know howouseould never come to pass
they were wonderful people
the world's companies and governments and nonprofits have delivery arments that are fully capable of converidence where
this is possible
even way its so hard
that's what happened was my dad
think it's scared mo
they get scared the walk around
my dad is austoinmersed as this
i'm trying to become a mtter person
and what i need now is to learn to me like that
theys want the game
and the problem we're solving is what are those things
charles bear with me
thank you very much
what would that change about how we live
i don'tpplay from scial computers they put me on the internet when i was younguy
they didnal world farm
what would that change about quality of life nutritional
why didn't you just tell me that
what can i learn with you
he's fine goood
so that was easy
and the way to do it is through the bloodstrep
we weren't considered the real thing
so we need the solutions and these people play a game they are to ran hunndred
so that's it for now
that's awful right
and one activist actually found a contract from a western ac comompany for sale who surveillance
and it's just incredible
i was serrifyed

can i get my uppprain
we must adapt that way of gavid back
i'm not sort
i would find there on one thing
it' five f years old
thought would be for that
it's not one way
and that's what i'm calling for years now
so you want to go to that point me but you only want to pay attention to buld an interest
so what do we do
we almost don't feel ourselves
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
you do the something you work
and so one of the major challenges of our projects really is to find photographs in the onays they can before something
we said yes
we were so excited
incredible people are warm and friendlyre pl
the same so how did b my bunch of stakes and sharks
the answer to that question is very definative
we are attachion to what others
it's all about what can it use to for me
does even take like a more of your interomotives weo values
and i said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them what of our crappping products
and we think about it makes a lot of sense because formula question is a really complex
let's think about your afnue fooot prints
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
we have to fix our education
hes technology col from plower
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
you' probably w one of
we have to fix the internet
most of the menopedia were shut down
n don't get me wrong
of course they want'
i could make that decision
that's not an improbleable simp
you know about teumber

it made me feel smart
how does something like that make to feel smart
i don't even know what's real job t it lked me ononest
