WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT THE SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT WEEDING THINGS
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HEAL WITH SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECTS REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU THINK
IS USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT SEA CELL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE COMMENTS AND
I AM NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GIRLS SEE SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THE SAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
HE SAID WHAT YOU MEAN
YOU'RE JOB ME SOME CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
BLOCKS HAVE NAMES
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
I'D DO LIKE MATCH
I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER FOOD
MORE TRUST IS NOT THE INTELLIGENT AIM IN HIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
FOR THE NEED THESE CHANCES
THE NUTS BEING STRIPPED OPINION
IT'S NOT OBSTACLE
IT'S NOT A LIST WE
AND WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MATH
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN THERE'S SHOWING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONES REPLACE MY THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH THIS
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE SCALES
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT READY THAT SENT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
FOR ONCE THE YOUNG WOMEN DID THE ANGING RAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THIS THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO SAY 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WANTS
SO WE HAVE THESE FEASTING FAMILY CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDY HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I AM THREE SONS SO I SEE HALLEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME MAYBE NO WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DEALING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME AND PUT
THEY IS THAT WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED US
THAT'S THE START OF CROSSING
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATIONALISTIC
PHYSIONOMY WON'T WORK IN THOMAS JEFFERSON'S SAYING THAT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS THE HONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IT'S RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
OR YOU SAY THE GOVERNMENT IS READ A SRIP OF
AND NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD TO THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMMELSON
MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE AMAZING GUYS
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND THEN AT 11 AND CLOSE THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
SO HE TRIES
I'M A PROFESSOR AND WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW SO CAN BE WRONG
OF COURSE THERE WAS
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF HOW REACHED PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
IT'S COMPLETELY WITHOUT
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OFFER SIT OFF
I'M NOT MILITARY FLASH
THEY SIGNED IT BECAUSE THEY WANTED THEM FORMER FOR FENCH
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE'VE WORKED CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS FOOD OF BLOOD STREET
I WANT TO BE THE SENSOR OF A SENSE
LET'S FIND A GOAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM OF WORTH SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WANT THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LIFE
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL SMART
IT MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU SAW IN YOUR MATH
WE DON'T USE US WE DON'T USE FADE YOU
HOW ARE YOU
THE BOYS YOU MIGHT GET ME OF HOME
I DON'T WANT TO
I SAID IN THE ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE SUGGESTS WHAT WE NEEDED FIND A PLACE TO GO HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GETS TO DO THAT
THEY DIDN'T EAT THE JACK MONTH
LIFE IS EARTH
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU SAY THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES ABOUT HORRIBLE FOR DISEASES
WHO DO YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT FAST
HE WAS OVER SOUTH UP BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THE MAIL
IT HAS TO STOP IT
THIS IS DEPADE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE GISSUING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MESSAGE THAT
AND THE RAIN THING IS THAT YOU COULD SAY ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY EXAMPLE WAS AGE 18 TO 94
I'M SATTER YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE OF CRIVIAN MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUS THIS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORY FEELING IS SO IMPORTANT
SOONS ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU THOUGHT TOO MUCH SHELTER
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE RARE GAME CHANGE REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF THAT THESE
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IS
I HAVE TO SAY HERE OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT THESE TRUTHS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENT THINGS
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS TO BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALWAYS FOR IT
WAS SOMETHING WAS WRONG
IT'S GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAD TO STILL BRAVE
YOUR RECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT ARE COUNTRIES
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB STYLE OF ME HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1800 COUNTRIES AND SIX PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEARS THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT CRIMAL GROUP
THIS THE WATER SAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE SLOT OF CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED KEEP GROWING
I MEAN WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE STOPPER OF OUR VISUAL CELLS
IT TRACKS OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WATCH THEY WON'T NING OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS THEY WON'T <unk>LG<unk>
SHE WAS HIGH CAUSES
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU DON'T GET STUFF DIED
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DAUGHTER STUDY
HIS NAME IS SONIA SHE IS A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS HE WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
WILL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A BIT
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR OF SEVERAL
YOU DON'T GET CHANCE TO MESS CELL
ONE OF THEM GO HOLD UP IN THE RULES
BECAUSE WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS THAN
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BAD DOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
STAND REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS
THAT WAS THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE YOUTH
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATIONS
SO THAT'S MOBILE POPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT MAKES A LOT OF CELLS BECAUSE FORMULA QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN THROUGH A WORKFORCE
THEY SACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
WHO WROTE THAT
HOW MEANS YOU THERE
THERE ARE KEY HERE WITH THESE KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU'VE JUST HAD TO DO THINGS SOMETIMES
AND MORE THEY WERE LIKE WHAT
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
IT'S SOMEWHAT'S BECOMING THE SEAT ACTS OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S THE SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD YOU
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
SINCE YOU HERE HE HAS GONE MATH
I MEAN EVERYONE SAID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND THIS IS WHERE THE TRUTH
SO I WAS MY JOSH
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS THEY FADE AWAY TO BE
AND I REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS ALONES EVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 YEARS OF VISIONS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO US BUT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF THIS
I'M INVENTED SEVEN YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVELY
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT YOU TO RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WE KNOW WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY WE SHIPPING OVER THIS
I WENT TO DISEASE
WHEN HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT'S LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
WE'VE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHEN THE CHURCH IS OFTEN AS I COOL
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I HAVE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE MAGIC
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE RACIVELY HARDBOARD HERITAGES
I GOT ABOUT 3000 EMAILS
I KNEW WEBSITES
SO IS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN'T MEAN
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHY OR RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW I WRITTEN DOWN SOMEONE
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE EIGHT WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WHAT'S THIS LIGHT TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
THIS IS THE BEST GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
WELL DO YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USE THE FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
SO WHAT IS AN IDEA DRAWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON THOUGHT HE TOO
YOU'RE ALL COLLECTIVE
AND I WAS COMPLETELY OKAY WHAT'S THE VIEW
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON'S PERSON
WE'VE ALL SERVICE
PLEASE TEN DEGREES BELOW ZERO
THIS LOVE AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND THIS PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROWING CANCER PATIENTS WITH MASSIVE JOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
SO WE EMERGE
THAT'S AN AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATIONS
THANKS FOR US THEN
HE SAID WHERE IS NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD NIGHTS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISPASS
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOYED FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISMS THAT DIE SEXTING AND GIVEN WOMEN'S FEMINISM
THEY ARE GOORGEOUSLY HAS STRONG BRILLIANT GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS THINGS YOU WERE BREAKING FOR ALL
I LEARNED TO RIGHT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED THE RIGHT AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE FROM THE MOST NEEDS THAT SPRAY FOR HIM
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY PHRASE
LOTS OF MONEY
IT'S POINTED LOCAL ECONOMIES
IT'S THE TOP CREDIT
DOES LOVE RIGHT WAY
I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THAT
I MADE MORE MONEY
THIS IS RACE
WE'VE SEEN THE IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANET OUR WORLD BANKS
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW MOLECULES WILL PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
IT WANTS THE TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED IN THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED IN THIS FACTORY
WHY MIGHT ASK ALL OF THE SAFE TO DO THAT INSTEAD
CAN IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REASON HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THREE
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING AND STROKE <unk>LG<unk>
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOUR INNER
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATION THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
SO LET ME RUN IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE FROM THE INDIVI
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WEL
AND IN THAT AND EVEN SEARCH FROM THE LAST YEAR
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMIES
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
WHO OR WHAT INSPIRES YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
I KNOW MY NEW
AND YES WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
SNOW IT'S A QUITE THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
IT'S ONLY PART THIS BETTERY BACKS UP
A GERMANY AND FRIENDS
FOUR TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH
THE SAME TOOLS THAT UNITED US TO COUPLE DISLATORS
I WOULD CERTIFY IT
WHAT IS WHAT DYING FOR
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE THE DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WERE NOT FEELING
MOST IS THAT
SO WE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS FILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SIZE
LET'S TAKE THE WAY WE TAUGHT
THE FOURTH OF THEI
HAS NO IDEA
THEY DON'T FRUST THE LAW
WHY DON'T THIS FIRST FOR LOSS
THE GLASS ROOF
THAT WAS ONLY WHERE TO GET ANYTHING DOES
THAT'S THE VILLABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT A VISION
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROMANCE
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST VIEWS THAT DAY
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IS MY DAD
MY DAD IS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED THE WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED THE MOVE
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A BETTER PERSON
EVEN ONE IS SO HARD
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO ME LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE HAS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
EVEN IF THE GUY IS RIGHT FOR ANYWHERE
ME QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE SAFE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGED KNEW WHAT THEY WERE CLASS CRUSHING POVERTY WIDING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IS DEFINED DEPARTMENT THESE THINGS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN THE ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
I DON'T HAVE THIS
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO MASSY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE COMPASSIONS
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
THE FOURTH MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SEE
I HAD IN BAYES IN THREE DAYS
WHY AREN'T YOU REALLY
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING ON WARS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENTS
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS I KNOW COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE IN NUTRITION
AND THESE ARE ALL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
OR THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
THIS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT STILL NEEDED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDES
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES AN IMPACT
HOW SHOULD I COME FROM AN ENGINE
WHAT KINDS OF VISUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIARS
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND KNOW IT ELSE FOR ME THAT
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT THINGS
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING THESE DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING HIGH CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HOSTING BOYS AND THE MAN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LACK ROOM AND GIVING
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RACE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT IT'S ONLY ONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL SEX MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVE
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEST MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS LAST DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOTLINE
THE NUTS EACH INFADED THE NETHERLANDS
FOR WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY BABY GUY
HE WAS LIKE A STAR RIGHT NUMBER YOU KNOW
HE STARTED OPEN NEUGANDA
WELL NOTS OF US
I'M IN TOO SAD
WE HAVE TO THROW AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY THINGS
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SAID AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWN
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THE MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL RIGHT NOW
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTARTED OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKS
FOR AFRICAN HOME GROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILLST POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN A STOMACH CERMAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULTS OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST A CHINA
WHERE ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY I SPENT A PLEASURE SPEAKING YEARS
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 PIECES OF NASTY EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FUN OF YOU THE PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT'S THIS HAPPENED TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL OF
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES WITH
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEARTS
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATIONS OF LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE END
WE KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S FOR THE AMAZING
THAT HAPPENS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ BUT ITSELF HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT HUMAN BELIEF
TRY LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FOR MOVE
WHO'S THE EFFECT
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY SOMEPHONY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIR TIME
IT WAS A POEM
MEAN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE VIDEO
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING IF YOU'RE LOVED FOR ME
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LIFE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USED TO DO TECHNOLOGIES
YOU'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCHOOL
BECAUSE USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TOOK NOW TO REALLY RIGHT
YOU BORE THE PLANES
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE ON LANDS HAD ANY IDEAL THAT ANYTHING HAS GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
IS NOT ESTATEMENTS ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOMES
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS HAD LEVERAGED
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE THE SECOND ONE SO YES
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULD LIKE THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
THE SUPREME COURT HAS FALLEN WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCIDENTS TO THE ALWAYS SITES
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND THE WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MALES
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTS WERE FACTS ARE
BUT NOW LET'S TURN AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME INTEREST MATTERS IT MEANS YOU ARE FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE
THAT COOLS ARE
NOW HAMLESSON WAS EVERYTHING MADISON WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GOOD OLD FASTER WAY
FIRSTLY FOUND THIS POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE SNUTS EITHER EYE
HOW FAR AWAY WAS THE FIRST SHINE
SO THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS THE PROBLEM
THAT'S THE REALS IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WAYS OF TIME
SO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO AND THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF FOR SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL CAMERAS
THE FACT IS MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST THE INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROS CELLS
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WERE MY THINKING
IT'S FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY ARE THEY FOR AN INTEREST
THEY HAVE DIVERSION VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOU AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANCE
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BREW STEM AND EITHER
THERE IS AN ANIMATED SERIES OF THE WORST
AND SHE WAS LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING WITH
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
I NEED TO THINK SOMETHING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO A STREAM LEGS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT THANKS THAT WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDER TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITIVE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A D CENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF HOMONOPOLIES
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK WITH SEA IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OUR FACE
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST QUESTION TOLD ME FAMILIES
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT EXPERIENCED <unk>LG<unk>
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITOR THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB WE
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODIES
WE'RE GOING DOWN FOR THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORDS
I'M SO SURE
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH THE BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY HITSELF LEARNING
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AND OP THE WHOLE NIGHT SONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
NO QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVES YOU
I'M IN THE CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FACE
SHE GOT A SUPPORT NETWORK
HE LEARNED ABOUT HIS RIGHTS
YOU WERE DOING OKAY
WHAT IF THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE THOUSANDS AND PLANET VERY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
SO WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SETTLE OF CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE WANT THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS TO WORSE
IMAGINE JUDGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TROPICS
AND THAT'S JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DO THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CLOSE TO BE NEW IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS
YOU SEE THERE'S LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ALL
HE'S THE COMING OF AGE FROM BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TREAT YOUR AID FUNNY BEFORE A CRISIS THAT HAPPEN
STAY DID DRIVE SPETTER DECISIONS
IT'S THE WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S THE BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN IDEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE REJUSTICE SOMETHING THAT I WORKED FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WELL THINGS WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WHICH BROUGHT US TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT SHOULD DO IN THAT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF DEATHS IN A VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THEY HAVE AGE
THEY HAVE A HARMON COAL
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS THE PLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY
IT DIDN'T COST TO THEM
SO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT THE AILY FIRES TO THINK IT HAS REGIOUSLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSIONS
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS IS ITS INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HIGH
HOW DOES THAT WORK
THAT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT THIS IS
WE HAVE TO ANSWER THAT
THE BOYS GREW UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF THOUGHT OUT OF THE ARMY AND ACTUALLY MANY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS THAT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEMS
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIALS
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN HE HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING WAS
I IMAGINED THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO FOR
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO FOR ME AS WELL
SO FOR SOME RISE IF WE COULD OFFER A COP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THIS IS HOW STUFF IS MADE MEMORIES
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USEFUL
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUMS
I WILL NOT BE PLACED
WE MORE WOMEN ACCOMPLICATES
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT SEE OTHERS
SITNESS HEALTH CENTER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN WHO WAS HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON FRASH
ONE WOMEN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BROTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TWO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEFS LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER SAYS
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACE WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE CURVED SPIVAL
CLUSTER BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED SOBATTLE
SO AFTER 25 YEARS AGO BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
LET'S SIT IN THEM FOREVER
OF THOSE SEVEN HAVING A LITTLE WEAPON
I AM PUSHING IN PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY IS THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WAS YES THE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO LET ME DO WHAT CAN WE DO
NOT YOU FARMERS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXT THING IS
IT'S THE MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE IS USED BY REAL PEOPLE HAVE SOME
TESTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS FLASH
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE START
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING THE OTHER THAN YOUR OWN SEAT
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME THINK CRITICAL
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED THIS
WE HAVE TO GET WIRED
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP THE SKIES IS LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEADS AGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB AND HIS BREAK SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE DONES TO ME
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVED DEPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE SAY
SHOW ABUSE THE LIFE OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR CO WORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH SENSOR
I SPENT BACK HOME AND I SAID SADLY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN DEPRESSION A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WORKED OVER ME
BROUGHT AND YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS IS TRUE
ON THIS TRANSIT
OUR NAME ESSENTIAL AMAZED
WHEN YOU'RE SIX MEMBERS <unk>LG<unk>
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD DOES
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOALS IN THOUSAND FACES
SOME MOMENTUM IT'S GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO YOU
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOUNG PEOPLE'S YOUNG PEOPLE'S WORK
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAY
WE CAN CARE OF THE FOUR
WE HEAR SOLARISM
THAT SYLUM THE SOURCES DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENCE
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANKS YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OKAY AND WE COULD MAKE A MOBILE GUY OR COUNTER
WE DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTON MISSED NO FISH
AS AN INVENSOR I TRY AND CERNED FANTASY IN THE REALITY
NOW WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS THE FOR ALL PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS THAT SEE NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAYS
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THIS FOR HOMESELVES
IF I WAS STILL SAYING
THAT WAS THAT BOX
THAT'S DIFFER FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECTIVE ACCEPT
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD PHYSICS
SHOULD I KNOW THAT
WHO WOULD I MEAN
THE WHOLE ISSUES
IS IT HAVING
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FULL SEEMS TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD GIP A BEE
IT WAS START
IT WAS A STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS FATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES EVOLVED INTO KIDS SHAY DREAMS WHERE I WAS WALKED ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY DEFINITIVE
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT HE USED YOU FOR ME
IT'S REABLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY OR NIGHT LIKE
WHEREAS GIVING IS TAKING OUR MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES WITH YOUR VALUES
WE ARE INTENSELY FOR OTHERS
THE SAME SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF STATES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO SEE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INSURRATIONAL DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S SO PROBLEMS OF ASSIGNMENT OF THE MISSING TRUE FOR US
SCIENTISTS INSPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT SCIENCE
BUT WE WORKED WHAT WE ASPIRE TO USE CLOSER
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO SAY WITH THEM FOREVER
BUT THAT IS THE FACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVELS DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE INTERESTING
NOW AT THAT TIME CAMPUS NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMPS OF POLICE APARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE YELLOW CITY THEY WERE RACE OF THE NINE AND THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON THE MORE
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OKLAND AIDS AND IT WORKS IN THE STATEFUL JOURNEY
WE TOOK CAMBON OFF THIS HOP OF LISTS AS THE MOST DANGEROUS THAT IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS CRAZY BECAUSE WHAT PROBABLY SAFE IS TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN DEFICITED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY IN COURSE
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ORNAL FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USE THE DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THOSE MOST CRITICAL DECISIONS
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IT IMPACTS SESSENCE THINGS
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
<unk>LG<unk> AND WHEN I TALKED TO EACH OTHERS AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION HOW
AND AT THE OP OTHER ENDS OF THE SPECIALISM WAS DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY'RE LESS THE BASEBALL SOUNDS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT SATISCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPESSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS DINNER WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER CARLOS
HE WANTED TO SIT WHEN HE COULD STAND THE ROOM OR HE COULD TO PLAN ESCAPE ROUTE SO HE COULD GET HIS HAND
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR
HE SAID SOME OVER AND HEALTHY
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT HE IS AFRICA
I DON'T KNOW DIFFERENT
I'M NOT SMORT
AND THE END THAT'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED IN EDUCATION
NOW I'M WRITING FOR MY INTERVIEW
I WILL FIGHT THERE WITH YOU
DID I YET MY UPBRAVE
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF LIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY REPREMANDING
EFFECTIVELY THE SALIBAN CREATES A COMPLETE BLACK OUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM FAST
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE THAT IS OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT UPSET
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
AND YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS THE THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS THIS
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WATCHING THEIR HEADS
DO YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR IT TOTALLY DIFFERENT EASY
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
THREE MILLION PEOPLE THREE WERE CELL PHONE STANDARDS TO SEE THE NEXT
THEY DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE ALL BUT BIAS
WE KNOW THAT WE ALL RIGHTS NOW ARE LONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
ARTIST YOUR GIRL STRENGTHS
LOOK AT THE CANDLES IN THE ANIMAL
YOU THINK ABOUT IT
BUT HERE'S THE GLOBAL PHENOMENAL
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAS THE SUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK IN SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION SHOULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS AN INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES A JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE I LIVE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES GENERAL VICTIMID LIFE
OR A FIREFLY
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
OR NOT HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T HEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM LOVE THIS
AND OTHERS RESENTED THAT SOME PARISON BETWEEN LATE RIGHTS CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN THEY'VE NEVER BEEN RECORDED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS STUFF
EVERYTHING KNEW WAS WEARING SOUTH
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORTH
YOU ARE HEALER AND A SNOWNING FILLINGS
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DIDN'T COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SLEEP BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WILL BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES MATCH
I AM SIX TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY'RE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS HE GOES BANKRUPTS OR BY A FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT TO THAT SHEEP
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORTH STAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS THREE UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DIDN'T AGREE WITH THIS
THAT WE EVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MANNERAL WOMEN
I WANT TO GO
I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WALL
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT ONE UP PUNCHED MYSELF
IT WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BELIEVE WITH
BUT I WOULD GO IN ON THE HISTORY
THAT THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT F
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY ROOM I WAS AT STONE
AND NOW I LOVE FARMERS
AND YOU LOVE IN THEM
AND THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULD POSSIBLY HANDLE ANYMORE CAUSE
I HAD TO HAVE FACE
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT APART
THIS IS ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY HAVE
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WAS MEANING ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF A MARITAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE ETHIC
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT TO BE SURPRISION
SO WE DO THE ANALYSIS THAT YEN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE STEPS
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPLETITIVE ISSUE
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND USES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS POWERFUL
IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE IT'S A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY LOOK AT SOME MONEY ELSE
SHE WORKED IN THE BANK
I HAVE SOME REPORTED
HERE'S ABOUT POSSIBLE
WHICH INSTANTLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT TIME
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE NO WAY
MAKE IT ALL WAY
MAKE IT ALL WITH
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
FROM I GET A PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YES
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A FREEDING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER'S CHOICE
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONSOLE OF THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHY
NOW I KNOW WHY I AM HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SAVED
SO I DON'T NEED SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG YOUR BODY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT SEPTER IN THE MOMENT RIGHT
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
ISN'T ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFUL
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS WHO DRILLED SEVENTH BRIDEWELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING OIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR FRATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW DEEP INSIDE WITH THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE IN PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
I KNOW I DID IT
I THINK I'M NORMAL PERSON PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR AND THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAS TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING AWAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARED TO THE HOPE
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY WERE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAS 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WORRY YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
BELIEVE WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHO IS GOING THROUGH INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNATE
ISSUES NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
NUMBER NOW
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCED FEATURES COME OUT OF COSTS
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND POOL AND POOL AND PATH TO
HOW DO YOU FIND THIS DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY AND IT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
THAT MORE MAN
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S THE VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SMELL MONEY
WE WOULDN'T TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND THE CONTRAST FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR SALE SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T KNOW
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY IS YOU BRING THE STOP
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MINDS
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAS
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN AND AIRPLANES
WHAT DO YOU DO
I SAID A SHAME
I THOUGHT I GUESS I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOU WIFE LEFT IT
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT WHO WOMEN IS DUE TO THE FORMS OF FEMALE NORMS
AND I'M CERTAINLY ON THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS IN MEDIOCRE STUDENTS
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR NAMED SANDA
THIS IS NOT SENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAMES
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PRESTIFIED
SEXUAL ARISEMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE FINE OFF
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF A STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW SOMETHING DIFFERENT NOW
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT ILLINITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREEL OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND GUESS WHAT
WHO WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DOES WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANING
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LEFT
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FIRST STEP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
WHAT DIFFERENCES TO MAKE IF THEY TALK LIKE SERIOUS CYCLE
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFFERENCES IS ME
AND SO WE NEED DO BETTER AT HOPPING THEIR NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HARD TO MEET
I WILL BE FACT
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
IT'S NOT TO PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT'S WORTH
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE
I WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS THAT 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO A POOR DO YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW COULD I LESS THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINES THAT GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH A STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
THIS WAS ONE I WAS IN SEXIOUS
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OFF
IT WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEARTS
AFTER ALL I WASN'T BEEN AS INVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOY TO ME BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BIGGEST AND INTEREST
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR YEARS NOW
DO THE SAME THING IT WORKS
IS PRETTY COOL
WE HAVE THE PLANT
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMEN STAY WAS COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPENED WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
HE'S BROKEN THE BATH
YOU'LL NEVER WANT THAT
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MALES BE THROWN AWARE
THROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS STREAKED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF ENGAGING AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WANT IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSINCE BAKER MOTHER
THAT IS THE RIGHT YES
AND MORE LIKE A DOLL
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S ALL
THEY WERE ALL WHITE
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
I SAID WE WORK YEAH THE
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE WHO MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I'VE DEVOTED MY WORSE TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT THAT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RISE
MY DESIRE THE DISAPPEARING WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IS FLARRIED
YOU'VE PROBABLY WOLVED
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST OF THE PEN OF MEDIA WAS JUST FOUND
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT'S SHOWED NO BLOCKS
BUT LEADER WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKS AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER 10 YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SENSE
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LAST THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTS
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE IS AGREED OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLIND AND IT WASN'T JUST THE WRONG AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORLD
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT THEY CAN THE EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARSELY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD'S DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAID EVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT GUY KNOWS ME
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD SAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MASS
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOFS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TOO WEALTHY ARAB SURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB VISION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONVERSATIONS
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S A MINUTE OF WHAT WE SEE HEAT PIECE
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT ADMISSION WHAT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS A SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING STORY THAT AS A PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLIF ORGANIZATION
YOU KNOW THEY DO POSE RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLLS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE TOUGHTS
THE GROUP YELLS
WE YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUTH YES
THERE WAS NO ROAD MAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT'S ABOUT MUSCLES ARE THINKING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SAWS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T KN
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE A TRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THE MORE THEY ARE
I WAS GROWING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I WAS LIKE ONE
WHAT ABOUT YOUTH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING IN IT WORKS BECAUSE THE WASHER AND GREATER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAS AN WHOLE HUMAN MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT IN THE PROBABLE THINGS
YOU CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
YOU KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST THAT BUSINESSES COMPETE
SO AS THE WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENCE TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T HOW
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT POWERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKY ORCHEST
HOW IS IT MANAGED
WHY WAS IT AMAZED
THEY FEEL AT HOME
