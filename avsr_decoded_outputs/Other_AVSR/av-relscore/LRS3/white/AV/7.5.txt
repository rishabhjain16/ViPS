WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HEAL WITH SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECTS REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKEN BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU SAY
IS USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANINGS
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT SEA CELL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE CALMNESS AND
I AM NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GILL SEE SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THE SAYING AND THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
HE SAID WHAT YOU MEAN
YOUR JOB MEANS SOME CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
BLOCKS HAVE NAMES
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT
I'D DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERFUL
MORE TRUST IS NOT THE INTELLIGENT AIM IN HIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
FOR THE NEED THESE TOWNS
THERE NOT BEING STRIPPED UP HERE
IT'S NOT OBSTACLE
IT'S NOT A LESS WE
AND WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN HE'S SHOWING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE GALLS
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT READY THAT SENT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
WERE ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GETS THE ANGING GRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THIS THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO SAY 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WANTS
SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FAMINE CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT SOME MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I AM THREE SONS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME MAYBE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DEALING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME AND PUT
THEY IS THAT WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED US
THAT'S THE START OF CROW SAYING
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T IT BE NATIONALISTIC
PHYSIONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON'S SAYING THE PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IT'S RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
OR YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT JUST READ A SIMPLE
AND NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD TO THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMMELSON
MUCH MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE AMAZING GUYS
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND THEN AT 11 AND CLOSE THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE ILL ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WE'RE THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR AND WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW SHOULD CAN BE WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WERE
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF HOW REACHED PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
THIS IS COMPLETELY RESULT
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP SIT IT OFF
I'M NOT A MILITARY FLASH
THEY SIGNED IT BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOME FORMER FOR FENCH
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE'VE WORKED CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOOD STREET
I WANT TO BE THE SENSOR OF ASSENSE
LET'S FIND THE GOAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM OF WORTH SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WANT THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LIFE
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
IT MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU SAW IN YOUR MATH
WE DON'T USE AUDIENCE WE DON'T USE FAILURE
HOW ARE YOU
THE BOYS WERE MINDED ME OF HOME
I DON'T WANT TO
I SAID IN THE ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE SUGGESTS WHAT WE NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GETS TO DO THAT
THEY DID THIS A JACK MONTH
LIFE IS THIRD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES ABOUT HORRIBLE DISEASES
WHO DO YOU KNOW
LET'S TOUGH DOUGH
HE WAS OVER SOUTH UP BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THE MATH
IT HAS TO STOP THE
THIS IS DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE ISSUING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY
AND THE RAIN THING IS THAT YOU CAN SAY ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY SAMPLE WAS AGE 18 TO 94
HOW SAT ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE OF TRIVIAL MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUS THIS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
SOONS ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU THOUGHT TOO MUCH SHARED THEM
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE RARE GAME CHANGE REQUIRES YOU TO FULL OFF AT LEAST
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IS IS
I HAVE TO SAY HERE OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT THESE TRUTHS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS TO BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL WAYS THROUGH IT
IT WAS SOMETHING WAS WRONG
IT'S GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAD TO CELL BRAVE
YOUR RECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT A CONTRADICTION
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB SIDE OF ME HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1800 136 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT CRIBAL GROUP
THIS THE WATER SAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE'S LAW TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
I MEAN WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ART OF VISUAL CELLS
IT CRACKS OPEN MY WORLD
SO IF THEY WON'T GO FOR A WALK THEY WON'T HING OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
SHE WAS HIGH CAUSES
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU DOG GETS OUTSIDE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DOG IS STUDYING
HIS NAME IS LANIAS AND HE'S A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS HE WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
WILL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A BIT
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR OF SEVERAL
YOU DON'T GET CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
ONE OF THEM GOT CALLED UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS THAN
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE I AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BAD DOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
STAND REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS
THAT WASN'T CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE YOUTH
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATIONS
SO THAT'S MOBILE POPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FORMULA QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN THROUGH A WORKFORCE
I TACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
WHO WROTE THAT
HOW MEANS YOU THERE
THERE ARE KEY HERE REALLY AS KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD TO DO THINGS SOMETIMES
AND POOR THEY WERE LIKE WHAT
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
IT'S SOMEONE'S BECOMING THE SEATS ACTS OF A NEURAL LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S THE SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD YOU
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO USE
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND SUPPORT CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
DID YOU HEAR HE HAS GONE MATH
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND THIS IS REALLY TRUE
SO I WANTED MY JOSH
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS THEY FADE ALWAYS TO BE
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS ALONES EVOLVED ROUGHLY 600S A YEAR OF VISIONS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO ART BUT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF THIS
I'M SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVELY
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT TO SEND A RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE GOING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY ARE WE SKIPPING OVER THIS
I WENT TO DISEASE
WHERE HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW KNO
AND THAT'S LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
WE'VE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHEN THE CHURCH IS OFTEN AS I COOL
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I HAVE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE MAGIC
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLESH AND THEY'RE RACIVELY HARDBOARD HERITAGES
I GOT ABOUT 3000 EMAILS
MY OWN WEBSITES
SO IS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN MEAN
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREAST
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW I'VE WRITTEN DOWN TO MY
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE SEVEL OF THE EIGHT WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WHAT'S THIS LIGHT TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
AND HE'S THE BEST GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
WELL DO YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USE THE FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
SO WHAT IS AN IDEA DRAWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON THOUGHT HE'S YOU
YOU'RE ALL COLLECTIVE
AND IT WAS THE PRETTY OKAY WHAT'S THE VIEW
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON'S PERSON
WE'VE ALL SERVED THIS
WHEN 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
THIS LOVE AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND THIS PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN CANCER PATIENTS WITH MASSIVE JOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
SHOULD WE EMERGE
THAT'S AN AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATIONS
THANKS FOR US THEN IT
HE SAID WHERE IS NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD NUTS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISPASS
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOYED FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISMS THAT DIE SEXTING ANY GIVEN WOMEN FEMINISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUSLY HAS STRONG BRILLIANT GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS THINGS DO THE BREAKTHROUGH ALL
I LEARNED TO RIGHT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED RIGHT AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE FROM THE MOST NEEDS THAT'S BRAVERY
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY PHRASE
LOTS OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES
IT'S THE TOP CREDITIVE
I LOVE READ WITH
I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
I MADE MORE MONEY
THIS IS RACE
WE'VE SEEN THE IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANET OUR WORLD BANKS
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORIES THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW MOLECULES WERE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
IT WANTS THE TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED IN THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED IN HIS FACTORY
WHY NOT ASK ALL OF THE SAFE TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THREE
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING AND STROKE <unk>LG<unk>
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOU'RE IN THERE
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE TO DESIGN TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
SO LET ME RUN IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE COMEDY IN THE M
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WEL
AND IN THAT AND NEED TO SEARCH FROM THE LESSON
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMIES
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF VISUAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
WHO OR WHAT INSPIRES YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
I KNOW ABOUT YOU
AND YES WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO LEADERS TO QUITE THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
IT'S ONLY PART OF THIS BETTERY BACKS UP
AND GERMANY AND FRIENDS
FOUR TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH
THE SAME TOOLS THAT UNITED US TO COUPLE DICTATORS
I WOULD CERTIFY IT
WHAT IS WHAT DIEING FOR
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT FEEL THERE
MORE THINGS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS FILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
IT CHANGED THE WAY WE TAUGHT
THE FOURTH OF THEI
HAS NO IDEA
THEY DON'T TRUST THE LAW
WHY DON'T THIS FIRST LOST
THE GRASSROOF
THAT WAS ONLY WHERE TO GET ANYTHING DOES
THAT'S THE VILLABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT A VISION
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE SECONDS
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IS MY DAD
MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED THE MOVE
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A BETTER PERSON
EVEN ONE IS SO HARD
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE HAS IT RELATES MENTORING
EVEN THE GUY IS RIGHT VERY WELL
ME QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE SHAFE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGED KNEW WHAT THEY WERE CASED CRUSHING POVERTY WIDING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IS DEFINED DEPARTMENT THESE THINGS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOST OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAIN TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
I DON'T HAVE THIS
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS DEAF
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO MASSY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE WRAPPED
I DIDN'T KNOW IS TO SEE
I HAD IN BAYES IN THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIES
I WAS WINNING ON WARS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENTS
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICED MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS I KNOW COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE IN NUTRITION
A DIGITAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
AND THIS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT STILL NEEDED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM AN AGE
WHAT KINDS OF VISUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIARS
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
YOU KNOW IT ELSE FOR ME THIS
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT DATA
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING THE DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HOSTING BOYS AND TO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RACE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL SEX MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVE
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEST MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS LAST DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOT LINE
THE NAZIS INFADED THE NETHERLANDS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY B B GUN
IT WAS LIKE A START RIGHT NUMBER YOU KNOW
I STARTED OPENING UGANDA
WELL NOTS OF US
I'M IN TOO SONG
WE HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHINGS
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SAID AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWTH
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST THE MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL RIGHTING
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTARTED OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORSE
FOR AFRICANS HOME GROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILLST POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAVE FOUND A LUMP IN A STOMACH CERMAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULTS OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY I SPENT A PLEASURE SPEAKING NEWS
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 SPECIES OF NATCHED THE EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT'S THIS HAPPENED TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES WITH
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEARTS
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATIONS OF LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE END
WE KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ MY SELF HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT HUMAN BELIEF
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FOR MOVE
WHO'S THE INVEST
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY SOMEPHONY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIR TIME
IT WAS A POEM
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR YOU
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING IF YOU'RE LOVED FOR ME
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IF THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES
YOU'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCHOOL
BUT IT'S USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO READ A FRIGHT
YOU BORE THE PLANES
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE ON LANDS HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAS GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
THAT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MELT NUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOMES
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS HAD LEVERAGED
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE THE SECOND ONE SO YES
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULD LIKE THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
THE SUPREME COURT HAS FALLEN WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE HOLY SITES
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND THE WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW LET'S TURN AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME WITH YOUR MICROSIS I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
NOT COOL IS THAT
NOW HEMILISON WAS EVERYTHING MADISON WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GOOD OLD FASTER WAY
FIRSTLY FOUND ITS POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE SNUSSY I'D EYE
HOW FAR AWAY WAS THE FINISHINE
SO THIS IS NOT THIS LOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS THE PROBLEM
THAT'S THE REALS IN BOSTON
THAT'S TERRIBLE WAYS OF TIME
SO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO AND THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF FOR SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL CAMERAS
THE FACT THAT'S MORE LIKE 5 PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST THE INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CARO CELLS
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WE ARE MY THINKIN
WHAT'S FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DIVERSION VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOU AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANCE
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BRINGSTONE EITHER
THERE IS AN ANIMATING SERIES IN THE WORST
AND SHE'S LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
I NEED THINGS SOMETHING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO A STREAM LENGTH TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT THANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDER TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU THERE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AS BEING UPSETED
WE CAN CREATE A D CENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF A MONOPOLIES
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK WITH A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST QUESTION CALLED ME FAMILIES
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED IN THE SAME
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITOR THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB WE
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN FOR THE CELLULAR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORSE
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY HITSELF LEARNING
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OPP THE WHOLE NIGHT SONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU KNOW QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVES YOU
I'M IN THE CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FACE
SHE GOT A SUPPORT NETWORK
HE LEARNED ABOUT HIS RIGHTS
YOU WERE DOING OKAY
WHAT IF THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DON'T WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SETTLE CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUDGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TROPICE
AND THAT'S JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS
YOU SEE THERE'S LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ALL
IT'S A COMING OF AGE FROM BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIGURE AID FUNNY BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
STAY DID DRIVE SPETTER DECISIONS
IT'S THE WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S THE BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM IT WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT I WORKED FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WHAT SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WHICH BROUGHT US TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT'S YOUR DOING THAT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS IN A VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THEY HAVE AGE
THEY HAVE A HARMON COAL
YOU MAKE IT FLOW HUNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T COST TO THEM
TO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT THE AIRLY FIRES TO THINK IT HAS REGIOUSLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSIONS
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS IS ITS INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HIGH
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT HE MISSES
WE HAVE TO ANSWER THAT
THE BOYS WERE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME HAVE THOUGHT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS THAT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEMS
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIALS
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN HE HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING WAS
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO FOR
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO OVER AS WELL
SO FOR SOME RISE IF WE COULD OFFER A COP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THIS IS HOW STUFF IS MADE MEMORIES
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USEFUL
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUMS
I WILL NOT BE PLACED
WE MORE WOMEN ACCOMPLICATES
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT SEE OTHERS
SICKNESS HEALTH GENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN WHO USED HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPPED HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TWO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEFS LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER SAID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACE WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE CURVES SPIRAL
CLUSTER BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONSAMINATED SOBATTLE
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
THEY WERE SITTING THEM FOREVER
OF THOSE SEVEN HAVING A CLEAR WEAPON
I AM PUSHING IN PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T YES THE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TAUGHT YOU FARMERS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXT THING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE IS USED BY REAL PEOPLE HAVE SOME
TESTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE STARS
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN SEAT
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME THINK CRITICAL
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED THIS
WE HAVE TO GET WIRED
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP THE SKIES IS LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEADS AGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB AND HIS BREAK SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE DONES TO ME
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVED DEPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE SAY
SHOW ABUSE THE LIFE OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR CO WORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
I SPENT BACK HOME AND I SAID SADLY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WORKED OVER ME
BROUGHT AND YOUNGER MENS
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS IS TRUE
AND THIS FASTER
ARE THE OPPOSITIONAL MAZE
WHEN YOU'RE SIX MEMBERS THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOALS IN THOUSAND FACES
SOME MOMENTUM IT'S GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOUNG PEOPLE AS YOUNG PEOPLE'S WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAY
WE HEAR THE CHARACTER FOR
WE HEAR SOLARISM
THERE'S SYLUM THE SOURCE IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENCE
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANKS THE VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OKAY AND WE COULD MAKE A MOBILE GAGGER COUNTER
IF YOU DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTS ON MISS NO FISH
AS AN INVENSOR I TRY AND CERNED FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOW WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS THE FOR ALL PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAYS
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T NOTICE THE HOME OF SHELF
IF I WAS TO SAY
HOW DOES THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFER FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECTIVE ACCEPT
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE ITS ARE TO ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD PHYSICS
SHOULD I GO THAT
WHO WOULD I MEAN
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HAVING
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOL SEEMS TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEET
IT WOULD START
IT WAS A STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS FATTER
WHY IS THAT HARS
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES EVOLVE INSTRUCTED SHAY DREAMS WHERE I WAS WALKED ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY DEFINITIVE
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT HE USED YOU FOR ME
IT AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY THEY'RE NICE LIKE
WHEREAS GIVING IS TAKING OUR MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES THREE YOUR VALUES
WHAT YOU'RE INTENSIONS FOR OTHERS
YOU'LL SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO SEE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S SO PROBLEM OF DESIGN BEING OFF THE MISSING SCHOOL FOR US
DESIGNERS ASPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
BUT WE WANT WHAT WE ANSPIRE THROUGH THE CLOSER
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO SAY WITH THEM FOREVER
BUT THAT IS THE FACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVELS DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE INTERESTING
NOW AT THAT TIME CAMPUS NEWS JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMPS IN POLICE APARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE SICKY AND THEY WOULD RAISE SOMETHING ON IT AND THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON A MOORE
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OKLAND AIDS AND IT WORKS IN THE STATE OF YOUR JOURNEY
WE TOOK CAMBON OFF THIS TOP OF THE LISTS AS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS CRAZY BECAUSE WHAT PUBLIC SAFE IS TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY AND HORSE
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ORNAL FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THESE MOST CRITICAL DECISIONS
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IT IMPACTS SESSENCING
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
<unk>LG<unk> AND WHEN I TALKED TO EACH OTHERS AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THIS DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION HOW
AND AT THE OP OTHER ENDS OF THE SPECIAL OF WAS DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY'RE LESS THE BASEBALL SOUNDS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPESSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED IN THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS A DINNER WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER CARLOS
HE WANTED TO SIT WHAT HE COULD STAND THE ROOM OR HE COULD TO PLAN ESCAPE ROUTE SO HE COULD GET HIS HAND
HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR
HE SAID SOME OVER AND HEALTHY
AND IT DOES THIS
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT HE IS AFRICA
I DON'T KNOW IT DIFFERENT
I'M NOT STORIES
AND THEN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED IN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY END OF VIEW
I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH YET
DID I GET MY UPBRAVE
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF LIVING BACK
THAT'S NOT SOME PROBABLY HAPPENED EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY REPREMANDED
EFFECTIVELY THE TALIBAN CREATES A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM FAST
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT UPSET
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
AND YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS THE THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS THIS
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WATCHING THEIR HEADS
DID YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR IT TOTALLY DIFFERENT EASY
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
3 BILLION PEOPLE TODAY WITH CELL PHONES AND THAT'S THE SEASON AS
THEY DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE ALL BUT BIAS
WE KNOW THAT WE ALL RIGHTS THEY ARE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
ARTIST YOUR INTERNAL STRENGTHS
LOOK AT THE END OF THE ANIMAL
YOU THINK ABOUT IT
BUT HERE'S THE GLOBAL PHENOMENAL
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAS THE SUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION SHOULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES SHELLY FISH THE MID LIFE
OR A FIREFLY
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
OR NOT HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T HEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERIES
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS SOME PARISON BETWEEN THE RIGHTS CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST IN ABSTRACT QUESTIONS
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN RECORDED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS STUFF
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WERE IS OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORTH
YOU ARE A HEALER AND A STONING'S VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DIDN'T COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WILL BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES MATCH
I AM SIX TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS TO GOES BANKRUPTS OR BY A FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORTH STAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CELLUS THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS FREE UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
LIKE WE EVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MANNERAL WOMAN
I WANT TO GO
I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT ONE UP PUNCH MYSELF
IT WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER FROM SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
BUT I WOULD GO IN ON THE CASE
THAT THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT F
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY ROOM MY RESEARCH STONE
AND NOW I LOVE FARMERS
I KNEW DONE THING
AND THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANYMORE CAUSE
I HAD TO HAVE FACE
IT WOULD BE A MALL IN NOT A PART
THIS IS ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKED TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF A MARITAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OF IT
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT TO BE SURPRISION
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS THAT YEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE STEPS
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETITIVE ISSUE
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS POWERFUL
IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
WAIT YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE IT'S A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET SOME MONEY ELSE
SHE WORKED IN A BANK
I HAVE SOME REPORTED
HERE'S ABOUT PALSE NEW
WHICH INSTANTLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT TIME
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE NO WAY
MAKE IT ALL WAY
MAKE IT ALL WITH
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
FROM I GET A PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YES
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A READING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER'S CHOICE
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHY
NOW I KNOW WHY I AM HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SERVED
THE IDON'T NEED SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG NEARBY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT SEPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT RIGHT
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
ISN'T ABOUT EQUALITIES
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING OIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW DEEP INSIDE WITH THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
I KNOW I DID THIS
I THINK I'M NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR AND THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAS TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARED TO THE HOPEFUL
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY WERE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAS 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WORRY YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO IS GOING THROUGH INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
NUMBER NOW
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCED FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND POOL AND POKE AND PATH TO
HOW DO YOU FIND THAT DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY AND IT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
CAME ON MAN
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S THE VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SMELL MONEY
WE WOULDN'T TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRAST FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR THE SALE SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY IS YOU BRING THE STAP
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MINDS
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAS
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON A AIRPLANE
WHAT DOES YOU
I SAID A SHAME
I GUESS I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOU WIFE LEFT IT
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT WHO WOMEN NEEDS TO DO TO CONFORMS OF FEMALE NORMS
I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS IN MEDIOCRE STUDENTS
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR IN AMAZONDA
THIS IS NOT SENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAMES
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PECTRIFIED
SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAMES THEY ARE TRYING OFF
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW IT'S ONLY DIFFERENT NOW
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREEL OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE THEY EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANING
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LEFT
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
WHAT DIFFERENCES TO MAKE IF THEY TALK LIKE CURY SCIENCE
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFFERENCE IS MAKING
AND SO WE NEED DO BETTER AT HOPPING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
I WILL BE FACT
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THIS IS NOT TO PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS THAT 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO A POOR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW COULD I LESS THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINES THAT GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH A STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
THIS ONE I WAS IN SECTIONS
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OFF
IT WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEARTS
AFTER ALL I WASN'T BEEN UNCERVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD THROUGH MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOY THAN ME BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BEST AND INTERESTS
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A RACE SHOW
WE ALMOST FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORSE
IS PRETTY COOL
WE HAVE THE PLANT
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMEN STAY WAS COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPENED WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
THEY'LL NEVER WANT THAT
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MALES BE THROWN AWARE
THROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF ENGAGING AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSTANT SPAKER MOTHER
THAT IS THE RIGHT YES
AND MORE LIKE A DOLL
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S ALL
THEY WERE ALL WHITE
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PHOGRAM
I SAID WE WORK YEAH THE
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE WHO MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I'VE DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEARING WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN FLORIDA
YOU PROBABLY WOLVE
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST INDEPENDENT MEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT'S SHOWED NO BLOCKS
BUT LINDA WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A 10 YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SENSE
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LAST THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTS
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLIND AND IT WASN'T JUST THE WRONG IN AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORLD
I YOU BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT THEY HEAR THE EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD'S DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAID EVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT GUY KNOWS ME
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD SAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MASS
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOFS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TOO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF ABOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB VISION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONVERSATIONS
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S SOMETHING NEWS OF ALWAYS SEE EAT PIECE
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULTY MISSION PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING STORY THAT AS A PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLIF ORGANIZATION
YOU KNOW THEY DO POLLS RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLLS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP YELLS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AS THE TOP OF THE MOUTH YES
THERE WAS NO ROAD MAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARS LOSER THINGING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SUCH
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T KN
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE ATTRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM MORE THEY ARE
I WAS GROWING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
ALTHOUGH ONE
WHAT ABOUT YOUTH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING IN QUARTERS BECAUSE THE WASHER AND DWIRER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAS A WHOLE HUMAN MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROBABLE THING
YOU CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
YOU KNOW ABOUT SOMETHING
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMTHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST THAT BUSINESSES COMPETE
SO AS THE WALL IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENCES TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T HOW
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRESS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING ORCHEST
HOW IS IT AMAZED
WHY WAS IT AMAZED
THEY FEEL AT HOME
