WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE'D LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
AND HE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED TO
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR FRONT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIC OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
COULD YOU EVEN HAVE EXPERIENCE THINGS ON SIMILAR SITUATION TRY TO GIVE YOU THINGS
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M FULLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
<unk>NS<unk> SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE HOMMENT AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THINGS MORE THAN YOU RIGHT THINK FOR EVERYTHING
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM Y
BLOCKS HAVE NIGHTS
WELL YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
I THINK YOU LIKE MAX
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERVIEW
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AME IN THIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
BECAUSE THINGS GIVE UP BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WE'RE GOING TO EAT THESE COWS
THESE THINGS THAT WERE THINKING
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL IT'S
AND YOU KNOW IT IS
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE GALLS
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED SENT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
AND ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE INTROGRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE THESE FIST AND FAMINE CYCLES
GO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON THIS
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBE AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
TO ACTUALLY STUDY HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE SONS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PA OF THE SAME SPECIES WE
REPART OF THE SAME VENTS
AND I WON'T NAME NAMES YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
DIDN'T MEAN FOR
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUOTE THINGS
THAT'S JUST SIX PEOPLE
WHAT IS THE PART OF THE
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUAL
BUT THERE'S THIS SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
IT SHOULDN'T BE NATURALISTICAL
THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THAT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
AND THAT'S A GOOD PROBLEM
WELL IT'S RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE THINGS AT ALL
OR DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I BELIEVE THAT
BUT DON'T REPRESENT WHAT HARDER BEING DONE
<unk>LG<unk> WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND CAMELS
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE MESSING DIES OF
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEY'RE THINKING BROADCASTERS <unk>LG<unk>
AND THEN AT 11 A CLUCK THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
I WAS BLIND
MY MOST PROFESSORS WERE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW I'M THINKING ABOUT THAT
THE FIRST THING IS
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUTRAGE PEOPLE
WE NEED TO KEEP TRYING TO DO IT
THIS IS COMPLETELY DESIRE
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP CITY HALF
I'M NOT A MILITARY BROUGHT
THIS KIND OF PEOPLE AND
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER TO
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE THE MEMBER OF THAT BENEFITS
AND YOU FIND A CALL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WON THE DAY IN
SO MEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LIE
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
IT MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU SAW HIM MAN
WE DON'T USE AUDIO WE DON'T CHOOSE VIDEOS
HOW ARE YOU
WHAT YOU MIGHT BE A HOME
I DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE
WE THINK IN ARRABIC AND
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT FORGET TO DO THAT
THEY HAD HIT THE JACK HOT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND THE
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU COULD BUILD THAT YOU COULD DO THINGS DONE BEFORE THEY CAN DO THAT
WHAT ABOUT FOLIO
LET'S HAVE DONE
THEY STUDIED UP OF COURSE
WE DON'T TRUST THEM IN
IT HAS TO STOP IT
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
AND THAT'S REALLY COMPUTERS
YOU WOULD BE ISSUING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY I
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
HOW SAD ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
I'M NOT QUITE GREAT AND ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE YOU LEFT NOTICE THE TRADITION AFTERWARDS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
<unk>NS<unk> WE WERE AMAZING
BUT WHAT GUYS
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH SHELTER THINGS
PEOPLE IN MY BEING THAT WOULD TAKE YOU RARE INTO THINKING REQUIRES YOU PEOPLE ON COMMUNITIES
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE YOU ACTUALLY WHAT KIND OF THINGS
I KIND OF THINK YOU'RE ON
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE
SO WE NEED TO SYSTEM AT HOW MANY ALL OUR PEOPLE TO BE A GOOD PERSPECTIVE
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALTHOUGH I THROUGH IT I
SOMETHING WAS WRONG
WE'VE GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAD TO CELEBRATE
YOU'RE RECONCILED LITTLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE WOULD LUNCH WITH PEOPLE WERE LISTENING TO ONE
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
I'M HERE WHERE I CAN
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT ARE CONTRADICTIONS
OTHERWHITE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S REAL JOB STYLE BEYONC
AND I COLD IT AND EVERYTHING
1800 PEOPLE <unk>NS<unk>
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
WITH THE WATER TODAY THEY'RE PREVERTY
WE DON'T NEED MOORE'S LAW TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
IT PRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WHILE THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T BE <unk>LG<unk>
SHE WOULD HIDE IN THE CLOSET
DO THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG IS THE ARGUMENT ON THAT
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE THEIR DOGS IS GETTING
HIS NAME IS WANNIE LAUNT AND HE'S A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
GOOD AT QUESTION IS THAT MORE THAN A HALF OF NIGHTS
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE TO PERFECTUATE ATTENTION IS THAT THROUGH PEOPLE'S DEFINITION
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A THING
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR ON TERRORISM
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT OUT
ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS THEY WERE TO DO MORE THINGS
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
AND YOU KNOW BACK TOWARDS THIS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAN REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE USE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATIONS
IN THAT PROBLEM OF NEGULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WE THINK ABOUT IT ABOUT THE SENSE OF THIS POINT OF TIME IT'S REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALL DO THAT THEY CAN HAPPEN TO THE POINT
I CATCHED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
WE WORKED OUT THAT
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
THE KEY HERE REALLY OF KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DID AN EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD A NEW THING SOMETHING ELSE
AND BEFORE THEY WERE MY COMMUNITY
HOW YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
RESPONSE BECOMING THE IMPACT OF A NEURAL LANGUAGE
ON THE UPPER HAND IN THE STATISTICS AND THIS LOVED THEIR FINISHING GOOD AND WE SHOULD ACCUSE
THINKING WHAT I'M SO GOING TO HAPPEN TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESIONS
YOU COULD GET TO THAT BORN MIND
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAVE TO
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND IS THIS REALLY THE SOLUTION
SO MY GOD
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER THAT FIND BETWEEN THE EXISTS THAT THEY CAN FAIL IN THE FUTURE
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS AND LOANS INVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 SENIOR THINGS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS
AND 27 YEARS OF
AND GOT PEOPLE WITH EVERYTHING
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT TO STAND THIS RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE GOING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHASTER TO ME
WHY ARE WE GIVEN OVER THEM
I WENT TO THE DEAM
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
AND I THINK THAT
AND THAT LITTLE PROJECT
WE HAVE TO TURN THAT RENT
BUT WHEN YOU CHARGE YOUR DAUGHTER IS NOT REALLY
IT'S A PERFORMANCE MENTION
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE IMAGINED
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 E MAILS
AND WHAT'S IT
AND SO IS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN MEAN
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RATES IF WE LEARN CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW IT WRITTEN DOWN SOME WAY
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DEVIL OF THE AGE WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WHAT'S THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT
BUT BE THE PICTURE
IT WAS THE BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE BOTH TIMES
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT OF
WELL LET ME GET TERRIBLE <unk>LG<unk>
AND GUESS THAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGENS
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
AND WHAT IS THAT IDEA DRAWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
YOU'RE ALL COLLECTED
AND IT COULD BE OKAY WHAT'S THE GOUT
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
AND CREATE THE INTERNET
THERE'S LOVE AND THERE'S FRIENDSHIP AND THERE'S PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE NEEDED THAT THIS PRODUCTION REAL RIGHT AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE'S SUFFERED SO MUCH
COULD WE MERGE
THAT'S ALL FOR RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THANKS FOR ASKING AND
BUT IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT FOR
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGED THE EPISODE OF THE BAD NUMBERS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPECT
I'M A FEMININE BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMAN'S FEMINISM
THEY ARE FORGEN WHO HAVE YOUNG BUILT FOR OUR FULL LOT OF BRAINS
SOME BOYS BROKEN WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO TO BREAK A GIRL
I LEARNED TO RIGHT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALWAYS BE A LITTLE BIT BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE STREETS
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
WATCH THE MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL THUMBS
IT WAS REDDICTED
AND I'M ONE REVENUE
BUT I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I COMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
AND THEY BELIEVE IT
IT'S GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANT OR A WORLD BANK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN THAT
WE HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH FACK EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANT THE OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
THEY WANT A TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WOULD BE IN THE BACKGROUND
WHY NOT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'M TRYING TO DAY YOU PEOPLE
DO YOU SURPRISE YOU MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING ATTACKS AND SURVIVE THE WHOLE FOOD OF SEXUAL INCLUDING PEOPLE
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN SUCCESSFUL
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
AND STORIES
BUT THE SECOND OF IT IS CLIMATE WE HAVE TO DO <unk>LG<unk>
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
I'M A NEURAL COOK LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE COMPANY ANYMORE
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WELL
AND IN THAT I NEED A CIRCUIT SCHOOL
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WESTPOINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
PEOPLE WALK FINE <unk>NS<unk>
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WIND FRIENDS
AND HE SAID YEAH
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOK AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL IN
IT WAS THE ONLY PART THAT BETTERY BACKED UP
I'VE BEEN BEING FRIENDS
4 TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH WE
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO POPPLE DICTATORS
I WOULD TERRIFIED
WHAT IS WORTH DYING FOR
THAT THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
IT NEEDS WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH US
WE'RE ALWAYS FUN MAKING PROBLEMS
WE WILL NOT BE HERE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY BLOCKING SCIENCE
TO CHANGE THE WAY WE THOUGHT
YOU GET THERE
THERE'S NO IDEA SO
THINK ABOUT THAT
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THEM OFF
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THAT WAS ONLY WAY TO GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT EFFICIENT
EFFICIENCY IS FOUR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPKENED WITH MY DA
MY DAD BROUGHT MY WIFE WEEKS
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED THE MOST
I'M TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PERS
THEY DON'T WANT TO FIND
WHAT I NEED NOW TO DO THAT
SO THIS IS IDEA OF STRANGE
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
HE DEFINIZED RIGHT VERY VERY
IT'S QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE CONCEIVED RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST CRUSHING POVERTY WIDENING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IS DEFINED COMPARTMENTS THESE THINGS
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND LET'S CALL THE FOUR BOUNDARIES
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AS GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMIT OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH THIS
WHEN WE BLOCKED THEMSELVES IN THE REASON FOR PEEDING AND WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WILL BOUND US WITH THEM
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAIN TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
<unk>NS<unk> I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
IT WILL BE CONVISIBLE TO KIND OF THINGS
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
TO PUT MIGRATION HAPPY AND
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW I SUCCEED
I HADN'T BAID IN THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
INSTEAD OF A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAVE BATTERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENT GROUPS
I'M ALSO ON THIS VISION BECAUSE THE REALLY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE IMPROVES THE
I KNOW PLATFORMS I KNOW COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG I
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
BOTH THAT CHANGED THAT FULLY OF LIFE IN THE FISHERIES
THE DIGITAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
AND THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE THEM WHAT CREATES MEANT FROM
HOW COULD I COME FROM A NATION
WHAT KIND OF RICH WAS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE DID
AND I HAVE NO MONEY I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT
BECAUSE I'M KNOWING THAT MOMENTALLY ADVERTISING THEM WHEN WE ASK THEM HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS AND TO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING THEM
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT FEEL LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ME ONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET TODAY WITHOUT THAT SENSE OF MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOTLINE
BUT NOT EACH BEING CREATED IN THE METAMENT
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY BVIGAN
YOU WERE LIKE A STARK RIGHT YOU KNOW
I STARTED OPEN YOU GONE TO
ON THAT THE BATHROOM
I'M A FEW ZONE
AND WE HAVE TO GO AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND THEN OPEN THE WHEN IT MEANS
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
WHY THE GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO AND SET AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWN
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IS IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITINGS
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED <unk>LG<unk>
FOR AFRICAN HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTIONS CAN BE A WILL TO POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TELL ME THAT DOCTORS WOULD SOUND THE LUMP IN THE STOMACH FROM ALL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 PEOPLE WITH NATCHED THE EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A DIFFERENT INTERESTING
AND THAT I TOOK THEM AND SOME SAFE GRADE
AND IN FACT WHAT'S IT HAPPENING IN MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT WINS WITH THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW LOCAL PLACES BUT
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE END
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S OUT TO US
WE CAN ONLY THINK THE ONE WAY
I USED TO RENT HELP HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT THE MILITARY
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS TO YOU
I WOULD LOVE YOU THANK YOU
PLEASE AFRAID OF THEM
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRPLANES
IT WAS A PALM
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR HUMAN
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVE FOR ME
I AM TORNED BY YOUR LOVED AND ME
BRING ME TO WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IT
AND I SAID I'M NOT
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IF THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
HE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORKED
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCORE
BUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW THE CREATIVE LIFE
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
AND THAT OUTCOMES
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE THINKING ABOUT PREVENTION AND BUILDING THINGS THAT WOULD BE COMING TOGETHER
YOU PUT MY CAMPUS
WE'RE CAN'T BE IN THAT COMMUNITY
THE SUPREME COURT IS FALLING WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS FROM ALL THESE LIGHTS
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
DID YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL BACKS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAVE TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THIS OTHER PART IN
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL MAKE ME WE NEED TO REFER TO FUNCTION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW HEMILTON WAS EVERYTHING MODICINE WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN A GOOD OLD FASHIONED WAY
FIRST THEY FOUNDED POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET SAME LESSONS
AND THE HARD THEY HURT THAT'S WHY I WERE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE DO NUTSY EYE TO EYE
HOW FAR THEY WERE MIND
SO IT'S NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL SYSTEM
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
THAT'S A REAL IN BOSTON
AND THAT'S A CAREFUL WAY TO FIND
DO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF WITH ME
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB I
THROUGH OUR NORTH SENAL CAMERAS
DETECTORS MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROSELF
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WHAT MY THINKING
YOU'RE FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY COME DIFFERENT INTEREST THEY
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANNELS
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND GREEN SKILLS EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
IN SHE'S LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONES
WITH ME THINK MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LINKS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDER TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WANT MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT WE'LL RUN YOU DOWN
HI I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
IT CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DAY TO DAY THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK WAS THE SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND I'M A GOOGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AN INTERESTING BUT MY HAND
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN YOU IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY WITH EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB THE
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORDS
I'M SO SIR
ONE YEAR ON ME RIGHT IDEA
YOU KNOW WHY DO YOU <unk>LG<unk>
YOU MADE IT WORKED WITH ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OFFER ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS
I'M IN THE PROOSIBLE RIGHT NOW
THANK YOU VERY MUCH <unk>NS<unk>
75 OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WASN'T HER FIGHT
FROM THE GOD AND HE FOUGHT NETWORKS
YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOUR LIFE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHEN YOU STUDIED TO DO THAT
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SETTLED CIVILIZATIONS
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUGGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TROPICS
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET MOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DO NOT REALLY DO THAT
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU EITHER DAUGHTER MEANS YOU JUST FILM OUT THEY DON'T THIN
<unk>NS<unk> COMING TO BE BRINGING DAY TO THINKING OF MANUFACTURING IMPORTANCE
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT CONNECTION TRIGGER A FUNDING BEFORE A DRIVING <unk>LG<unk>
THEY DID DRIVE BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIN ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMANDS
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED FACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FROM WORKING FOR YOUR KIDS REALLY
THEY BROUGHT UP WITH THIS
WHAT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LAUNCHING THE CHEST GENERATION WANTS LIKE YOU
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
DO THEY HAVE AGED
DO THEY HAVE A COMMON COAL
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRED
SOME JIT NOT EVEN NICE
EVEN THAT WASN'T A MOUTH
HE WANTED TO CREATE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVELS
I DIDN'T HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
GO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT DAILY FIRES TO THINK AHEAD SPEECHFULLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS ISN'T INFORMATION THE
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT SO PROPOSITION ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HIGH
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT HE MISSED IT
WE HAVE THE INTERNET
THE BOYS ARE OUT THERE FOR A YEAR
WHEN WE GOT OUT OF THE ART AND AS WE SPENT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM IN THE POINT
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED IMPORTANT THAT MOST 100 YEARS
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN HE HAD NO CHOICE
JUT WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE HUMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO WERE
AND WE CONNECTED OVER A REALLY SMALL THING LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVED COMPANY WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO THE LITTLE WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WENT
AND I GOT PRETTY COMPUTERS
AND HOW STOPPED MADE MEMORIES
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND MUSICAL
I WILL CRASH MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
WE MOURNED WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I TRULY NOW I'D NEVER BE ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
STICKNESS HEALTH GENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN PEOPLE PREPARED
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
WOMEN SHOOT THEIR FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPS HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER THAN ME THE LUMP OF EVERY TIME CAR
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEART SPOKE
FACE WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE HER SPIRAL
BUT THE LONG STRESS BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TO BACKLE
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
THEY WILL SIT IN THEM FOREVER I
OF THOSE SEVEN HAVE NEVER WEAPONS
I AM POINTING IT FULLYING WITH THIS OBJECT
YOU'VE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED THE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TOPE TO FARMERS
HOW COULD WE BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE ABUSED BY REAL PEOPLE HAVE THEM
CATCHING HAS DEVELOPMENT FROM THE BLACK
WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN KEY
IT IS NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO CRITICALLY
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED IT
WE HAVE TO GET QUIET
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DISGUISED AS LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT I BELIEVE TO BREATHE IN THE WALL THREE JOB IN THIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THERE'S GONE TO MEET
WE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOBAL COMPARTMENT OF OUR PARTS
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOWS USEFUL LIE OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
AND I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
YOU KNOW AND I FEEL THAT WRITTEN ABOUT ME HOW WALKED OVER THEM
BROUGHT HIM YOUNGER MEN
YOU ABOUT MOVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DO THIS
AND THIS IS TRUE
AND THEY ATTRACT THEM
I LIVE FOR ME
WHEN YOU'RE SICK MAYBE YOU'RE DONE
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS HUMAN LONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOALS AND SOMETHING STATEMENTS
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
I'M NOT COMMUNICATION
WE HEAR THE CHAOS OF WALL
EACH YEAR TERRORISM
THAT CRYING UP THE GIRLS WHO DID NOT NEED TO BE TRYING TO
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
LOOK AT IT WE CAN DO THE MOMENT THAT YOUR COUNTER
YOU CAN DRIVE AROUND
AND HE GAVE VIOLENT YEARS
WE DON'T HAVE MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTON MAKES NO FISH
AS AN INVENTOR I TRY AND TURN FANTASIES INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET LUNG BENEFITS
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROGRESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO BROAD PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THE MOVING WAY FROM
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S HOMELESS SHELTER
5 PERCENT DAY
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM ACTION HAVING INFECTED MECHANISMS
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
COULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY POOL SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD GIVE UP BEING
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHAT YOU DO THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATE DAYDREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY DEFINITIVE
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
AND ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU DO TO IMPROVE
SO IT WOULD BE BUT MORE THAN FRIENDLY KIND OF THINGS LIKE
WHEREAS GIVING AND TAKING OR MORE OF YOUR INNERMOTIVES WHERE YOUR VALUES
WHAT ARE YOUR ATTENTION FORWARD OTHERS
THEY'LL SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO THE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTION DESIGNS
IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THE FULL PROBLEM OF DESIGN BEING OFTEN BETWEEN THE SCHOOL FOR ART
AND NINE HAS ASPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT DENIERS
WHAT WE WANT WHEN WE INSPIRE FREE HOPES
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET UP OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER 
AND THAT'S YOUR THING IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WOULD DO LIKE A LOT OF LOW LEVEL FRIENDS ON THE STREETS DIFFERENT <unk>NS<unk>
NOW AT THAT TIME CANVADA NEW JERGEE WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CANDON POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
THEY WOULD TAKE A YELLOW STICKY THEY WOULD WRITE SOMETHING ON IT THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON BOARD
ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS TO GO
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THINGS
WE HAVE THOSE SUBSTANCES
IT WORKED FOR THE OPEN A'S AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
WE TOOK CANDON OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE POLICY TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY IN COURT
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARNOLD FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
THEY GET MY SECOND THING
IT IMPACTS CRIMES AND VIOLENCE
<unk>NS<unk> AND WHEN I TALK TO JEDGES AROUND IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAVE THE THINGS
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS THING AND
AND AT THE OFF OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY'RE LIKE THE BASEBALL SCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THERE WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPECTED FROM THE TIME COMMUNITY THAT INHIBITED PEOPLE GO FOR
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WHEN YOU FRAME THEM HOWEVER YOU PUT THEM THEY DON'T HAVE
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER CARLOS
WE WANTED TO SIT WITH HE COULD STAND THE ROOM WHEN HE COULD PLAN TO ESCAPE ROUTES HE COULD GET HIS HAND
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
PEOPLE OVER AND HELP ME
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
I DON'T THINK THEIR FRIENDS
I'M NOT SHORT
I CAN'T MUCH THIS PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY END OF YOU
I WAS RIGHT THERE IN THIS
DID I GET MY UPGRADES
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF LIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING BEFOOS HE IS SEVERELY RECOMMENDED
EFFECTIVELY THE THALIBAN CREATES A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO FOOL THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT AND IT TURNS OUT
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OF THIS
WE DIDN'T MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
THE ONE GROUND AND QUITE THE THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WATCHING THEM <unk>NS<unk>
DID YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
IF YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HANDS NEED TOO
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PATH
THREE MILLION PEOPLE SAY TO CELL PHONES HAND BACK TO THE INTERNET
DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS SUSTOMERS
WE CALL IT BIAMS
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT THEY ARE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
PARTISTS YOUR INTERNAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END OF SEE THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DATE FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
THE TWO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
AND YOU CAN DO THINGS THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS I
I WANTED TO COME TO TAKE SOME PEOPLE
SO I STARTED REALLY BRINGING MY COMMUNITY
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
THESE KINDS OF RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES A JELLYFISH IN MIDLIFE
OR A FIREFLY
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
NO NOT HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYED
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T CARE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERAGE
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAVE RIGHTS THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ASTRAP QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD EVER BEEN REPORTED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WEARS OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE HEALER IN A STONING VILLAGE
LET ME TRY THAT THIS MORNING
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE CRIPPLES
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC PASSION
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS TO WALK AND THE RATE HAVE CREATIVE INNOVATIVE VALUES
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS THAT GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE THAT IDEA
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORTH DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL SHELL THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
LIKE WE EVOLVE ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND THOUGH I THINK IT MEANS THEY NOT LOUDLY BE UNTOUCHED MY COMMUNITY IN THAT WORLD
I WANT TO GO
I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE TO FIGURE THIS SOMEONE ANOTHER <unk>LG<unk>
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT THINK TO MYSELF
HE WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER SOMETHING THAT'S GARY COMMUNITY
BUT I WOULD GO IN ON OCCASION
AND THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FU
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOMETIMES
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAUSE OF MY FOOD AND MY BEST THINGS
AND NOW I LOVE LANGUAGES
I KNOW NOTHING I'M
WOMEN I THOUGHT AND IT BROUGHT ME TO BE A FEMININE
SO I DIDN'T CAN BE ACTIVE
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANYMORE CARS
I HIDE THEM HAVE THINGS
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
IS IT ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED FORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
CAN WE INVENT LABOR WORK MENTIONS
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL PROPERTY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIZE AS WELL
IT'S SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE UP
LET'S GO BACK INTO THE VERY QUESTION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON WHO HAS GOT TO BE STRATEGIES
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TASTE
SUSTAINABILITIES HAVE GOTTEN TO BE A FREQUENT PETTERNATION
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS POWERFUL
IT'S THAT CAME NOT THAT FOR
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
HE WORKED IN A BANK
I HAVE TO IMPORT IT
HE CARES ABOUT FALSE NEWS
WHICH INCINNALLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT TO ME
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS WAS YOUR CANCER
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE IT AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT ALL WIN
YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
AM I GOING TO DO THIS <unk>LG<unk>
WELL NOT YET
BUT I'VE TRIED TO DO A CREATION AROUND ME FROM THE FRIENDS
SO WHAT MOTHER CHOICE
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION THAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE FORCES
BUT GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I AM HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
BUT I'M GOING TO GO ON THE RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HOME CONGO DRIVE
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING YOUR MOMENT THIS
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
IS IT ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS TO BUILD THE SECOND CRIME BELL AND WRITING HOW MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH IS FINDING OIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW DIFFERENT SIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE POP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JOINT I
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I COULD HAVE A NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUNDS
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH WAY MORE THAN PEOPLE KIND OF THINGS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THEM AS TIME TO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARCE TO THE HEALTH THEM
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY DON'T WE SUPPOSE TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAIN THING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WHITE NOT THE PITS
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
NOT RIGHT NOW W
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A CONCEPT
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
YOU CAN GET AN AWAY FROM IT
WE PUSH AND POOL AND POKE AND FROG THINGS
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
AND THAT WAS MEANT
YOU GO WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU'VE TO KNOW MONEY
THINK ABOUT IT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I WARN WITH YOU WITH
AND ONE ACTIVIST MENTIONED THEM CONTRACT FROM THE WESTERN COMPANY WHO FAILED SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH NO
WHY IS YOU DOING THIS UP
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
I'M A FISH INTERACTION CAMPAIGN
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AN AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I STUDY SHAME I
I GUESS I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW
YOUR WIFE LAST YEAR
I MADE A MISTAKE
YOU HEAR FOR YOU TO DO THAT
WE ASKED WHAT THE WOMEN WHO COULD BE TO WANT TO FEMALE MORE AND
AND HE'S WRITTEN NOT THE PART OF HIS WORKING
I WAS A MEDIO FOR STUDENT
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR IN AMAZON
THIS IS NON SENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAMES
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR SHE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
IT'S NOT GOING TO DO SOMETHING EXPERIMENTATION
NOT A LOT OF PANS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTION AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE SHOWING ON
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW DOES ON ME DIFFERENT THAT
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANINGS
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LIVED
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION WHEN
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN A
WHAT DIFFERENCE IS IT MAKES IT TALK LIKE JURY SIGN FELT
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T BE WHAT WOULD IN FRONT OF ME
WELL WHAT DIFFERCE DOES THIS MAKE I
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
IT'S NOT A PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND
ARE WE FRAVE ENOUGH TO WORK ON IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
TO THE MOST STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO OUT FOUR YOU WANT TO BE RENTED
HOW COULD EVER BE DOWN
INTENSIVE STEP DATE ALWAYS WHEN PREDICTIONS
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH THAT STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RICH WAR
THIS WAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
THEY HAVE HER SCANNED INSIDE OFF
AND LISTENING TO BEHIND
AFTER ALL I WASN'T BIT UNCONVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD FOR MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS THAT INTEREST IN
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT PUT UP HOME AND THINKING NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
IT'S PRETTY COLD
WE HAVE THE PLANT
BUT IF THEY DON'T THINK THERE THE INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMEN'S DAY WAS COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
IT'S WHAT THE PIECE OF JUNK MAIL CAN BE FROM AWARE
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGED
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONTAGION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WHAT'S I GOING TO DO IS
HAS BEEN GAVE THEIR MILES
THAT IS READY <unk>LG<unk>
AND MORE FLACK ADULTS
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFATHER
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
THEY WERE ALL QUIET
SO THEY'VE FOUND THE WAY TO DO COME BACK
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
I SAID WE WALKED TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY OF THE PICTURE AND I DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY OF THE CARE FOR OTHERS
AND WE NEED TO DO THIS
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE'S AT A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE AND FLORIDA
YOU PROBABLY WON'T WANT TO
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST INDEPENDENT MEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO BE THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO PICK OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKCHAINS
THAT LINKS WERE LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOL BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORK
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM WITHIN THE EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUE THE BATTLE
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HEARTLY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD COMPANY GOVERNMENT BE NON PROFIT HAVE DELIVERING ARTISTS BUT FULLY PEOPLE RECOVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDENCE <unk>LG<unk>
I FEEL THAT I AM NOTICED
AND THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE FIRST THING DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S SO WRONG INTERESTING THINGS
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MASK
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOTS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB LEGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLENTY OF WINNING FROM
THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS TO EAT PIZZA
YOU WORK YOU FEEL MONEY AND YOU MIGHT HAVE BEFORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT IMAGE TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE YOU LIVE ON AS SOMETHING STORED THEN IF THE PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
<unk>LG<unk> COMING OUT OF PLATE HOME WITH GALLIBORGAN STATEMENT
YOU KNOW THEY DO POLLS RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLES
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP OF GELS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROAD NOW
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT YOUNG MALE MEMBERS
LIFE IS BREAK
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN IS YOUR KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SOCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE TRY ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS GROWING THROUGH A HARD TIME OF WEST
I'LL SAY WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING ANY QUARTERS BECAUSE THE WASHERING DRYER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAVE HUMAN BEINGS WITH
THAT'S NOT IN THE OTHER PEOPLE
AND THAT'S REALLY SAFE
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBER
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST LET BUSINESSES CAN BE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DID IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUNKY FOUR KIDS
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT MADE
THEY FEEL AT HOME
