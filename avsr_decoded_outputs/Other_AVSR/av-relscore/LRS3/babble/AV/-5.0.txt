WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT WEED IT DOES
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY US
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MATURE CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECTS REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNEW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE COMNESS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
I SAID WHAT YOU MEAN
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM Y
PLOCKS HAVE NUMBERS
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERVIEW
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN HIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WE DIDN'T EAT THESE CARS
THEY'RE NOT BEING STRIPPED OPINION
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL
IT'S A NON ELECTRIC
WE'VE DONE A RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPRESS AN AMAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN THAT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WE WERE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE GALITY
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT REGULATED SENT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
WHO ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE ANGIGRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT WE PROBABLY WANT
SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FAMILY CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE SONGS SO I SEE NOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME MAMES BECAUSE NO WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEY KIDS GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED
THAT'S THE STATUS QUO TODAY
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATIONALISTIC
THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THAT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL OF
DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M AT THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTY
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE BASIC HAS
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND THEN AT 11 AND CLUG THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WE'RE THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WOULD
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF HOW REACH PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
THIS IS A COMPLETELY RESULT
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP SITTING ON
I'M NOT A MILITARY RACK
THEY SIGN IT BECAUSE THEY WANT SOME FORM OF A VENGE
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WERE CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOOD STREET
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF POTENTIAL
LET'S FIND A GOAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WANT THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LIFE
HOW DO SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
AND MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WE DON'T USE AUDIENCE WE DON'T USE VADIO
HOW ARE YOU
THE BOYS ARE MINDING ME OF HOME
I DIDN'T WANT TO
I SAID IN THE ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE I GUESS WHAT I NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GET TO DO THAT
THEY CAN LEAD THE JACK POT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORRIBLE PROCEDURES
WE'RE UPON YOUR
LET'S HAVE THAT
THERE WAS OVERSET THAT BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THE MIND
IT HAS TO STOP
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T SURE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE ISSURING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY
AND THE RIGHT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY EXAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
I'M SAT ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE OF DRIVEN AND MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUS IS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH SHAKE
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE RARE GAME CHANGES REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF AT LEAST
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN EXACTLY WHAT TIME IN IS
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACH CHILDREN
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
WAS SOMETHING WAS WRONG
IT'S GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAD TO CELEBRATE
IT RECONCILING WITH LIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT ARE CONTRADICTION
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DYING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB TYLER TO BE HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT CRIMAL GROUP
THIS IS THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T EAT MORE SOLAR TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GROWING
THEY MEAN WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE GUESS WHAT THEY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MATH HAT PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL DANGERS
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO IF THEY WON'T GO FOR A WALK THEY WON'T HING OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
SHE WOULD HIDE AND CAUSE IT
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU DOG ITSELF DIED
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DARK IS THAT
HIS NAME IS LAUNI HUNDRED HE'S A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA MIGHT TALK ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATING A STRESS ACTIVATION
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A PAIN
DON'T THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WORLD TERROR
YOU DON'T GET CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
ONE OF THEM GO CALLED UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 10 PEOPLE HAD THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BACKDOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAIR REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICING
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALK
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT IS
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE YOU USE
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S MOBILE POPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FORMULA QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN TO A WORKFORCE
ATTACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
YOU WROTE THAT
ARE ME TRUE THERE
THERE ARE KEY HERE REALLY KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DID AN EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD A NEW THING SOMETIMES
AND BOY THEY WERE LIKE ONE
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
IT'S ALMOST BECOMING THE SEAT TAX OF A NEURAL LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD USE
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL GO EASIER
DID YOU HEAR HE HAS ON MAD
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND IT'S THIS READING THE SOLUTION
SO I WANTED MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS A FAILED RECIPE
AND I REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS ALONES EVOLVED ROUGHLY 600S A YEAR OF VISIONS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO IT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF US
I'M EVENT TO SEVERAL YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WERE OFTEN SURPRISED
I WANT TO STAND THIS RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE GOING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY ARE WE SKIPPING OVER THIS
I WENT TO THE THING
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S SUNLIGHT TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
WE'VE CATHED TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHEN THE CHURCH HIS OFTEN AS THAT KILLER
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE IMAGINE
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 EMAILS
MY OWN WEBSITE
AND SO IS WHAT IT WAS AT WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE CAN EARN A CALCULATE DONATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW I'VE WRITTEN DOWN TO MY
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WHAT'S THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
AND IT'S THE BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
WELL DO YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
THE WAY IS AN IDEA DRAWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO DO
YOU ARE COLLECTIVE
AND IF IT'S THE PRETTY OKAY WHAT'S THE JOKE
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
WHEN IT'S 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
TO LOVE AND THEIR SFRIENDSHIP AND THEIR PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT OF WORK
AND SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
COULD WE EMERGE
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF THE LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THAT'S FOR ASKING
I SAID WHERE IS YOU NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE BAD IT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOYED FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMEN'S FEMINISM
THEY ARE COORGEOUS AND HEADSTRONG BRAIN AND CURVES WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAIN
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO TO BREAK AT ALL
I LEARNED TO WHITE LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST NEED SUCH BRAVERY
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
IT'S POINTING LOCAL ECONOMICS
IT'S A TOP CREDITOR
I DIDN'T HAVE RED WORK
I'M GOING TO BE SO HELPING
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I COULD PACK THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
I MADE MORE MONEY
THE STRAIGHT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BALLOON PLANET OUR WORLD BACK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN A STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE ORDER WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
IT WASN'T THE TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
WHY GOING TO ASK ALL OF THE STATES COULD DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVAL OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL REPRODUCE INCLUDING THREE
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN AS A CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOUR INDIA
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
LOOK AT ME WRONG IS NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE NOBODY EMAILS
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WEL
AND IN THAT AND IT IS SURGERY LESSON
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
YOU WERE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THEY CREATED
YOU KNOW WHAT INSPIRES YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO READ TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
IT'S THE ONLY PARTLET'S BETTER IMPACT UP
AND GERMANY AND FRIENDS
FOUR TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE'RE NOW ENOUGH
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO TOPPLE DICTATORS
I WAS TERRIFYING
WHAT IS WE'RE DYING FOR
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMATE OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WIH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE THAT EVERYONE WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
IT'S CHANGING WHERE WE TALK
THE PHOTO OF THAT
HAD NO IDEA
THEY DON'T FRUST THE LAW
WHY DON'T THEY DRUG THE LONG
IT'S NOT TRUE
THAT WAS ONLY WHEN GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT CONVICTION
IF THIS EASY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMMED OVER THE LAST FEW NECK DAYS
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WERE
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED BY DAD
MY DAD IS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY SCARED THE MOVE
I'M TRYING TO GIVE A BETTER PERSON
EVEN WHEN IT'S SO HARD
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES MENTORING
IS IT THE 99 21
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGED KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST CRUSHING POVERTY WIDE
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WE'RE VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE AND DEFINED DEPARTMENT TO THESE DAYS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT'S OR VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
IT DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
I DON'T PUT IT
THE SCIENCE IS THERE
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW IF SUCCEED
I AM BADE IN THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS I HEARD COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE AND NUTRITION
AND THESE ARE ALL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESS
I DID THIS HAPPEN EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDES
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM A NATION
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND KNOW WHAT ELSE WE DID
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT LATE
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS AND TO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE IS AN ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOTLINE
THAT NOT EACH INFADED THE NETHERLANDS
FOOD WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WE MIGHT BE MEETING
IT WAS LIKE A START TRAP SOON YOU KNOW
I STARTED OPENING IGANDA
WELL LOTS OF US
I'M A TOO SONG
WE HAVE TO THROW AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SAID AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWN
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL RIDING
HE WAS FAULTING MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICANS HOME BRONE SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILL TO POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP AND HIS STOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPEND IT OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULTS OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHERE I SPENT A PLEASURE SPEAKING YEAR
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 PIECES OF NASTY EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAVED PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN
AND THAT MIND THEM IN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES BUT
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSIONATE MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF YOU BRING THE IMAGINATIONS OF LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE END
WE KNOW WHAT
WE KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT HAPPENS ACTUALLY HAD ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ BUT HIS SELF HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT HUMILITY
TRY AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE THEM HER
USE THE EFFECT
WHATEVER REALLY IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN MUSE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
IT WAS A PARLIAMENT
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR HUME
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVES FOR ME
I AM TORN BY YOU LOVE AND ME
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LIFE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT AND HOW IS IT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING GOOD TECHNOLOGIES
YOU LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMES YOU THIS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCHOOLING
BECAUSE JUICEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO SHARE NOT TO READ THE RIGHT
YOU BORE THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE ON LANDS HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MEL NUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FAGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN NEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE THE SECONDS ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULD CAUGHT THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
THE SUPREME RECORD HAS FALLEN WAY DOWN FROM WORLD USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE WHOLE SENSE
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR TO
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAKERS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL AT THE SAME UNDER A MICROSCOPE I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
NOT CALLS THAT
NOW HAMLETIN WAS EVERYTHING MADISON WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GIRLS FASTER WAY
FIRST THEY'VE FOUND THIS POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY I WOULD ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT SEE I'D EYE
HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS THE FINISH LINE
THOUGH THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
BUT THIS REALS IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
SO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION THAT'S MY JOB
THROUGH OUR NEW EXTERNAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
CAN WE FINALLY FEAR IT OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CARO SOUTH
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
RIGHT THAT ONE MIGHT THINK IT
WHAT'S FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY HAVE AN INTEREST
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANNEL
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE IN BRINGSTONE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
AND SHE'S LOOKING AS A YONG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
ANYTHINGS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ARE THE FRONT NAKES SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT YOU RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITIVE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF HOMONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
THAT'S A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHER SON NOT IS INTERESTED AS I AM
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS HAD EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB WE
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR OUR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORKS
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OPERA WHOLE NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVES YOU
I MEAN IT CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FIGHT
SHE GOT A SUPPORT NETWORK
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHTS
WE'RE DOING OKAY
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS AND DOING HOUSE CASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMB ACROSS SETTLE OF CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE WANT THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUGGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TOPICS
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA
IT'S IT COMING OF AGE FROM BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER AID FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN IDEA MAN
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LARGESTIC COMPANY THAT I WORKED FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WHAT SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WOULD BROUGHT US TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SOMEWHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS IN A VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
YOU THEY HAVE AGE
THAT THEY HAVE A COMMON COAL
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARK CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID AND THAT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I SHOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
COOPIC UP THE KEYS
ARE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT DAILY FIRES YOU THINK ABOUT STREACHINGLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR BRITISH
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLY ODD
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT THIS IS
WE HAVE TO CANCER THAT
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF THOUGHT OUT OF THE ARMY CAN ACTUALLY MANY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE NEW PROBLEM TO YOU
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN IT HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WONDER
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DIDN'T
AND RECONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO REALLY WELL
SO FOR SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NOW
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THIS IS HOW STUFF IT'S MADE MEMORABLE
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USABLE
I WOULD CRAFT MY OWN JUMP
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
WE MORE WOMEN CAMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN USES HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEETS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WHEN WE STRAPS HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TWO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACED WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE CURVES SPIRAL
CLUST THE BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TO BACKLE
SO AFTER 25 YEARS AGO BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRAW
THEY WERE SITTING IT FOREVER
OF THOSE SEVEN FAVORITE GIRL WEAPONS
I AM PUSHING IN PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT OUT LUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY IS CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED THE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TOOK TO FARMERS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXT THING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE THAT'S USED BY REAL PEOPLE HAVE SOME
TEXTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO CRITICALLY
YOU HAVEN'T CALLED IT
WE HAVE TO GET CRYING
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP TO SKIES HIS LIFE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY NEED TO READ AND THE WALL STREET JOB AT HIS BREAKSHINING FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE DEPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOW ABUSE THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR CO WORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
SHOULD I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER BEING
BROUGHT IN YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS IS TRUE
ON THE ATTRACTIVE
OUR LAB POTENTIAL MADE
WHEN THEY'RE SIX MAYBE YOU DO THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD I KNOW
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOLDS AND THOUSAND FACES
SOME MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR PLANET IT'S SO HARD FOR HOW DO WE GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PARK
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO YOU
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
BEHIND THE CHAOS OF WAR
WE HEAR TERRORISM
THIS SYLUM MAJORITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENT
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OKAY THEN WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE LAGGER COVER
WE COULD DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTON MISS NO FISH
AS THE INVENTOR I TRY AND TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOW WHEN YOU GET DONE CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WEIGHT
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A WHOLE SHELTER
IF I WAS A DAY
THAT WAS THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFER FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECTIVE IDEA BUT
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
COULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HAVING IT
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOD SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEE
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES EVOLVED INTERCATE DAY DREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS VERY DEFINITIVE
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
INGREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE WARMING FRIENDLY IN THEIR NICE YOU'RE PLAYING
WAS GIVING AND TAKING OUT MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES WHEN YOUR VALUES
WE ARE ATTENTION TO OUR OTHERS
THE SAM SURROUNDED BY BINS OF STATES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO THE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THIS WHOLE PROBLEM OF DESIGN BEING OFTEN MUST ENDERSTOOD FOR ART
DESIGNERS ASPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
BUT WE WANT WHAT WE EXPIRE TREES THE CODE
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
BUT THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE ATTRACTIVE
NOW AT THAT TIME CAMBON NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMELON BELIEFS DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A DELLA STICKY THEY WOULD RIGHTS OF DENIA AND THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON IT MORE
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBER IN TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OKLAND AIDS AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW TURNS IN
WE TOOK CAMPLING OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST ANTRY CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS CRAZY BECAUSE WE'RE PROBABLY SAFELY TO BE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY IN COURT
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT NEURONAL FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK TO
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IT IMPACTS SENTENCY
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALKED TO EACH OTHERS AROUND IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BUY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION OUT
AND AT THE OP OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY'RE LIKE THE BASEBALL SCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTRUM THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WOULD YOU TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER COLOS
AND HE WANTED TO SIT WHEN HE COULD STAND THE ROOM WHERE HE COULD THE PLANET ESCAPE BROWSER HE COULD GET HIS HANDS
HOW DID YOU CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER IT HELPED THE
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
I DON'T LOOK THERE FOR AN
I'M NOT SHORT
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M WRITING FOR MANY INTERVIEW
I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH IT
IT I DID MY UPGRADE
WE MUST ADAPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY REPREMANDING
EFFECTIVELY THE DOLLAR PART CREATE A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE UNDER DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
DID YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS TO THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT VERY TOTALLY DIFFERENT RATING
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
TREE BILLION PEOPLE TODAY WITH SELF BORN SCANDICS AND SEE THAT
THEY DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE'RE ALL BEEN BIAS
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW ARE ALL
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAIN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
ARTISTER INTERNAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END OF THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES JELLYFISH A MIDLIFE
OR A FLY OF FLYING
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
NO NOT HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM RECOVERING
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAY RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD NEVER BEEN RECORDED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING YOU KNEW WAS WHERE IS OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORLD
YOU ARE HEALER AND A STONATE'S VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DIDN'T COME AROUND
AND SO IT WAS PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THIS SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IMAGINE
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO RAIN HOW CREATIVELY INNOVATIVE THERE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BREASTER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS THAT GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THIS GETTING WORST DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS OF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST AGREE WITH THIS
THAT WE EVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MEN OR WOMEN
I WANT TO KNOW
IT WAS LIKE OH THEY AM WAS ON
THEY WERE CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVER
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES IN OUR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WOULD TAKE A JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WE ARE NOT PUSHED MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER IT WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED BY THE MIDDLE BIT
BUT I WOULD GO INTO OCCASION
AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT 
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY ROAD MY RESULT STONE
AND NOW I LOVE LANGUAGES
AND YOU NOTHING THAT
AND THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANYMORE CARS
I HAD TO HAVE FAILED
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
ISN'T ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS IT POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK A LITTLE BIT PATHY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OTHER
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON WE'VE DOT THE BEAST OF PEACH
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE JAMES
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETENTIAL
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT ART
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE THE STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET NO MONEY ELSE
SHE WORKED IN THE BANK
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
WHO CARES ABOUT PUZZLING
WHICH IN SALLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT OF TYPE
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE IT AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO IN
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PARENT
YOU MIGHT GET A PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A READING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER CHOICE
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP PROMOTION WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHY
NOW I KNOW I AM HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG CALLING TO BUY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING THE MOMENTARY
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
ISN'T ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CARE FOR ME
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINALLY WHAT YES
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW THEM INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE NOT SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE COP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FOR PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS ARE LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
I KNOW I DID
I THINK I'M A NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR AND THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE BOOKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WILL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARCE AT A HOPE
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD A LEVERAGE CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WORRY YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO WAS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
NOW RIGHT NOW
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME OUT OF COST
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE EMOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NO WAYS BACK
WE PUSH AND POOL AND POOL AND BROAD THINGS
I DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY IS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
THAT MOMENT MEANT
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SPELL MONEY
WE WILL TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR THE SALE OF SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING THIS LAB
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAS
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN THE AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU
I STAY ASHAME
I THOUGHT I GUESS I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOUR WIFE LEFT YEAR
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO CONFORM TO FEMALE NORMS
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS IN MEDIOCRE STUDENT
AND THAT'S WHAT NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR NAMED SON
THIS IS NON SEX
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SUCH AN ARRASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DON'T WE ENAVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANING
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
NOR WHERE SHE LIVED
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEAKS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
WHAT DIFFERENCE IS MADE IF THEY TALK LIKE JURY SIGN FELT
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL I WANT DIFFERENCES THIS MAKE
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HARD UNIQUE
I WON'T BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
THIS IS NOT TO PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT'S A RESPONSIBLE TO
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO A POOR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW COULD I LET THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED TOOK FOOD BUT THE WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH IT STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING AS TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
THIS WAS ONE I WAS IN TEXIOUS
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OUT
I WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WASN'T BEEN UNCONVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOY THE MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS THAT INTERESTS ARE
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING IT WORKS
IS PRETTY COOL
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMAN'S DAY WAS COMING UP
WELL LET'S GO LONG TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WELL WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S A LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
HE'S BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAN TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE
THAT'S NOT SO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONTAGING AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS THAT GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BIGGER MATHI
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND MORE LIKE A KNOW
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFORWARD
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S ALL
THEY WERE ALL WHITE
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
UNTIL WE WORKED TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER HOLD YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME ABOUT
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I HAVE DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR AND WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE OF FLARID
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST OF THE PEN MEETING WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLARGES
BUT LINDO WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A 10 YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLINK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRANK AT AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORLD
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT THEY CAN LEAD EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAID EVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE BOSS
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROUTES
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TOO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOBING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE FOR WAYS TO EAT PEACE
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME WORK
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT ADMIT TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING A STORY THAT AT THE PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLOB ORGANIZATION
YOU KNOW THEY DO POSE RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLLS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE STOCKS
THE GROUP SHELLS
BUT WE'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROAD MAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT DONE DOWN THAT WORLD
LIFE IS A GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN USER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T KN
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE ATTRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS GROWING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I LOOK WHY
WHAT ABOUT TRUTH
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRILLIANTIC WARNERS BECAUSE THE WASHER AND JOINER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROBABLE SAMPLE
YOU CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBER
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST THAT BUSINESSES CAN BE
SO US TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKLING ORCHING
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT MANAGED
THEY DON'T FEEL AT HOME
