WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT AND WORKED OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE GOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT WHEN IT DOES
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY US
HE WAS SMILING AND I WAS SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE NATURE CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECTS REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT TEACHER
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNEW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE COMMONISTS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM BACK
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT SAYING THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
I SAID WHAT YOU MEAN
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
PLOCKS HAVE NUMBERS
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERVIEW
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIMING HIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRY TO APPROVE TRUST
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WE DIDN'T HATE THESE GUYS
THERE NOT BEING STOPPED OPENING
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL
IT'S A LOT OF COUNTRY
WE HAVE DONE A RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPRESS A NAME THAT
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN THAT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS WE DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WE WERE NO WORTH IT
SO REALLY THINK HAPPENS TO THIS ENGALITY
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT READY THAT SET HOME
I'M NOT SURE ANYONE
WHAT WAS AGAIN WOMEN AT THE AGILE GRAM AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CAN SOLVE THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT THEY PROUD REALLY WANT
SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FAMILY CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ALL THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE TO BE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE SONGS SO I SEE NOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME GAMES BECAUSE THAT WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR ARE THEY REACHED
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARRYING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME PUT
THEY KIDS GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED
THAT STARTS QUOTE TODAY
OF JUST SEEK PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T THIS INDIVIDUALS
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATURALISTIC
IT WAS THE TIME IT WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THAT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SAYS TO MAKE TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH THIS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE CALLED OUR PRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL OF
AND YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD READ THIS TRIP O
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMMERTY
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE BASIC HAS
BUILDINGS CAN BE LESS PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCATS THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND THEN AT 11 IN CLUG THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WE'RE THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WOULD
BUT THIS IS WHY I HEARD FROM A LOT OF HOW REACH PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
THIS IS COMPLETELY WITH OUR
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKINGS AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP SITTING ON
MY MILITARY RIGHT
THEY SIGN IT BECAUSE THEY WANT SOME FORM OF A VENGE
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
AND YOU LOSE IT YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WANT TO WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WERE CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOOD STREET
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
THAT'S PHYSICAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WANT THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LIFE
HOW DO SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
AND MADE ME FEEL SMART
AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WE DON'T USE ALL YOU WE DON'T JUST VADIO
HOW WARE YOU
THE POINTS YOUR MIND ME OF HOME
I DIDN'T WANT TO
I SAID DIDN'T GARAB IT
AFTER COLLEGE I GUESS WHAT I NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GET TO DO THAT
THEY CAN LEAD THE JACK POT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORRIBLE PROCESSES
WE'RE BORN YOU
LET'S HAVE THAT
THERE WAS EVER SET THAT BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THE MAN
AND THAT'S THE STOP
IT'S A DEMAND ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT I FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T SURE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE DISHERING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTICAL
AND THE RIGHT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY EXAMPLE WAS AGE 18 TO 94
I'M SATTERNED RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE OF DO LIVING IN MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW NOT SERIOUS THIS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORIES HEALING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH SHAKE
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE WHERE GAME CHANGES REQUIRES GOING TO PULL OFF AT LEAST
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IN IS
I HAVE TO TAKE HERE OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WILL I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
WAS SOMETHING WAS WRONG
IT'S GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE ADD A CELEBRATING
IT RECONCYLED WITH LIVERS IS RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENED TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT ARE CONTRADICTION
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WITH DYING
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB TITLE TO BE HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME HIGH
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO OUT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT CRIMAL GROUP
THERE'S THE WATER STATE OF FOREVER
WE DON'T KEEP MORE SO ON IT CAN THINK YOU
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GROWING
THEY MEAN WE HAVE PROBLEMS AND WE GUESS WHAT THEY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MATH HAT PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ALL OF VISUAL DANGERS
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO IF THEY WON'T GO FOR AWAY THEY WON'T HING OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
SHE WOULD HIDE AND CAUSE IT
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU TALK ITSELF DIED
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR TALK IS THAT
HIS NAME IS LAUNI HUNDRED HE'S A VETERAN OF FREEDOM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA MIGHT TALK ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATING A STRESS ACTIVATION
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A PINK
DON'T THINK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WORLD TERM
YOU DON'T GET CHANCE TO MESS ENOUGH
ONE OF THEM ARE CALLED UP IN THE ROUTE
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS I WANTED TO DO MORE THINGS
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 10 PEOPLE HAD THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS BASICALLY WALKED
THERE WERE NO BACKDOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAIR APPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WATER
WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT IT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE YOU USE
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANY POPULATION
SO THAT'S MOBILE POPULATION
I LOVE BELIEVE ALL BOX
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE BEST A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FORMULA QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN TO A WORKFORCE
ATTACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
YOU WROTE THAT
I'M NOT TRUE THERE
THEY ARE KEY WITH THESE KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DID AN EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU'VE JUST HAD A NEW THING SOMETIMES
AND BOY THEY WERE LIKE WHAT
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
IT'S ALMOST BECOMING THE SEATTACKS OF THE NEURAL LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S THE SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD USE
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IS NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL GO EASIER
DID YOU HEAR YES ON MATH
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AND YET IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND IT'S THIS READING THE SOLUTION
SO I WANTED MY DAUGHTER
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS A FAILURE REGIMEN
AND I REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS AND YOUNGS INVOLVED ROUGHLY SIX YEARS A YEAR OF VISIONS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO IT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO WITH ALL OF US
I'M DEVENT TO SEVEN YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WERE OFTEN SURPRISED
I WANT TO STAND THIS RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE DOING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY IT WAS SKIPPING OVER THIS
I WANT YOU TO THINK
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S SUNLIGHT TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
IN THAT LOT MEANS THIS PROJECT
WE'VE HAPPENED TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHEN THE CHURCH AS OFTEN AS THAT KILLER
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE IMAGINE
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT EVEN BASICALLY CARBON CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 EMAILS
MY OWN WEBSITE
AND SO IS WHAT IT WAS AT WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTH LEADER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE CAN LEARN THE CALCULATE LONELY
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW HIM WRITTEN DOWN TO ME
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WEIGHT OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WAS THIS KIND OF TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
AND IT'S THE BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF OR WERE FULLY TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
WELL DO YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USE THE FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY HAD AN OXYGEN TO METHOD AND GAS
NOW WHAT IS AN IDEA DRAWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
YOU ARE COLLECTIVE
AND EVERYTHING BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE JOKE
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
WHEN IT'S 10 DEGREES BUT THOSE ZERO
TO LOVE AND THEIR SFRIENDSHIP AND THEIR PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE JOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
AND SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
DO WE EMERGE
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF THE LEADERSHIP BY COMMUNICATION
THINGS WERE ASKING US
I SAID WHERE IS YOU NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WHENEVER RIGHT TO RESPECT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT TO KNOW A PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOYED FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GOT FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMEN'S FEMINISM
THEY ARE COERCIOUS AND HANDSTRONG BRINGING CURLES WHO ARE THROUGH A LOT OF BRAIN
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS COULD DO THE BREAKTHROUGH
I LEARNED TO WHY LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WHAT IT AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST NEED SIX PLAY FOR HIM
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
IT'S POINTING LOCAL ECONOMICS
IT'S A TOP CREDITOR
WE DID THAT FRANKWARD
I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW HIGH IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
I MADE MORE MONEY
THE SCRAIGHT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANET OUR WORLD BACK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WOULD NEVER WENT OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT KNOW WRONG
THEY WANT THESE TREATMENTS
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FASTER AND HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED IN THIS FACTORY
WHY CAN I ASK ALL OF THE CHANGE COULD DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL REPRODUCE INCLUDING THREE
AND GUESS WHAT SILLY CONVALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN AS A CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TELL IT OFF
YOUR INDIA
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATION WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
LOOK AT ME RUN IS NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE NOBODY ANYMORE
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WEL
AND IN THAT AND IT IS CERTAIN RELESSON
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START POINTING AN ENTIRE CLAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THEY CREATE
YOU WON'T WHAT IT SPILES YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMAN FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT
AND YES WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO READ TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
IT'S THE ONLY PART IT'S BETTER AND BACKEDUP
A GERMANY AND FRIENDS
FOUR TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE'RE NOW ENOUGH
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO TOPPLE DICTATORS
I WAS THERRIFYING
WHAT IS WE'RE DYING FOR
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS THAT HAVE A DOMATE OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMTHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TAUGHT MAKING FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
NOT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE THAT EVERYONE WAS WILLING TO BUY MY BOOK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
LET'S CHANGE THE WAY WE TALK
THE PROVE OF THAT
AND NO IDEA
THEY DON'T TRUST THE LAW
WHY DO THEY DRUG THEIR LONG
IT'S NOT TRUE
THAT'S ONLY ONE GAY ANYTHING DID
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT CONVICTION
IF THIS EASY IS FOUR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST FOR THAT LIVES
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WERE
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED BY DAY
MY DAD IS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED YOU WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED THEM OVE
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A BETTER PERSON
EVEN WHEN IT'S SO HARD
WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES MENTORING
IS IT THE 99 21
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGED KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GASED CRUSHING POVERTY WIDE
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WE'RE VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE AND DEFINE DEPARTMENTS THESE DAYS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WITH OR VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF AS HE CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WE'RE BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
IT DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
HAD A POINT
THE SCIENCE IS THERE
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FULL PRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY AND LADITION OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW IF SUCCEED
I AM BAY THE THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU WILLING HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS RUNNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I DON'T PLATFORMS OUT OF COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE NUTRITION
AND THESE ARE A WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESS
DOES THIS HAPPEN EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDES
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I KNOW FROM A NATION
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND NO ONE ELSE BEGINNING
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT LEADING
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING ON A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS INTO THE MAN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE IS AN ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE'VE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT ONLINE
THE NAZIS INFADED THE NETHERLANDS
FOR WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER IT WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WE MIGHT BE MEETING
IT WAS A START DREAM SOON YOU KNOW
IT STARTED OPENING GANDA
WELL LOTS OF US
I'M A TOO SONG
WE HAVE TO THROW AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO WHY THEY SAY
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SAID AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWN
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO EVERY DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL RIGHT NOW
HE WAS FAULTING MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO BE STARTED OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICANS HOME BONE SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WORD TO POWER
IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP AND HISTOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULTS OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHERE I SPENT IN PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 PIECES OF NASHTY EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAVED PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT MIND ME THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW LOCAL PLACES WITH
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSIONATE MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF YOU BRING THE IMAGINATIONS OF LIFE AND WHAT DOES THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BODIES IN THE END
WE KNOW WHAT
WE KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTIONS ACTUALLY HAD ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S OUT TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ BUT HIS SELF OUR BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT HUMILITY
TRUCK AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE HIM HER
YOU LOOK AT THE EFFECT
WHAT I'VE REALLY IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY REBORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIR TIME
IT WAS A PARTY
PAINTING RUNS TO IN MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FIGURE
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVES FOR ME
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LIFE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT HOW WAS IF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USE A GOOD TECHNOLOGIES
YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW COMES TO THIS ONE
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCHOOLING
BECAUSE JUICE WHAT WERE EVERYBODY TO SHOULD NOT REALLY RIGHT
YOU BORE THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE ON LANDS HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING NOT WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FAGHER CULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN NEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULD CAUGHT THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
THE SUPREME COURT HAS FALLEN WAY DOWN FROM WORLD USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER AMOUNT ACCESS TO THE WHOLE SENSE
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR THE
WE NEED TO CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAKERS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTS WILL FACT SAW
BUT NOW LET'S TURN AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL THE SAME INTERNET BETTER SO IT MEANS YOU A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
THAT CALLS THAT
NOW ABLETIN WAS EVERYTHING MADISON WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GIRLS FASTER WAY
FIRSTLY FOUND THIS POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY I WOULD ALIVE RIGHT
HOW DO WE DID IT DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT SEE AND I
HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS THE FINISH LINE
THOUGH THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
BUT THIS WAS A BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
SO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THROUGH OUR NEUROSCERAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
CAN WE FINALLY FEAR OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BACK FROM THE GROUND TO THE CARO SOUTH
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
THAT ONE MIGHT THINK IT
WHAT'S HALF YEARS OLD
THEY ARE DIFFERENT INTEREST
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHAIN
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE IMPROVES DOWN THE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATE SERIES IN THE WORKS
AND SHE'S LOOKING AS A YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND THESE THINGS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ARE THE FRONT NAKES SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT YOU RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITIVE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF ARMONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHECK WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
THAT'S SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALM THE FAMILIES
MY BROTHER SAID NOTICE INTERESTED IN THE AM
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS HAD EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB WE
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR OUR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORDS
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MAY HAD WORKED FOR ME
AND THEN PUT ON AN OPERA WHOLE NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
NO QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHERE IT MOVES YOU
I MEAN IT CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FIGHT
SHE GOT AS SUPPORT NETWORKS
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHTS
IT WAS DOING OKAY
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS AND DOING HOUSE CASES AND PLANETARY
WHY CAN WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMB ACROSS SET OF CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE WANT THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUGGLING A SNOWBOARD ACROSS THE STOPPINGS
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ARE
IT'S A COMING OF AGE FROM BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER A FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HELP THEM
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN ITEMATE
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED BACK AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE NEW JUSTICE COMPANY THAT I WORKED FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WHICH SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WHAT'S BROUGHT US TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SOMEWHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS AND ARE VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
YOU THEY HAVE AGE
AND THEY HAVE COMMON COAL
TO MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARK CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID AND NOT EVER WENT
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SO WE NEED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LOVEL
I SHARE HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
COULD PICK UP THE KEYS
ARE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT DAILY FIRES YOU THINK IT'S TREATURALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR MISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLY HIGH
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THINKING THIS IS
WE HAVE TO CANCER THAT
THE POISON WERE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF THOUGHT OUT OF THE ARBIT CAN ACTUALLY MANY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE NEW PROBLEM TO YOU
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE YOU NEEDED
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN YOU HAD NEW CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING I WONDER
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DIDN'T
AND RECONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE ONTO MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR NEW FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO REALLY WELL
SO FOR SOME RISE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NOW
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT BRINGING TO IT
THIS IS HOW STUFF IT'S MADE MEMORABLE
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USABLE
I WOULD GRAVE MY OWN JOB
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
WE MORE WOMEN CAMP TOGETHER
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM GETS HAVE SILENCE
AS SEEN NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN LOSES HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEETS ON TRASH
WHEN WOMEN SHOOTS OUR FACE
WHEN WHEN WE STRAPPED OURSELF
WHAT WOMEN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH OF TWO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES STUFF WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACED WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE CURVES SPIRAL
GUESS THE BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TO BACK HOME
SO AFTER 12 FIVE YEARS AGO WE HAD TO BE AND THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
THEY WERE SITTING IT FOREVER
OF THOSE SEVEN FAVORITE GIRL WEAPONS
I AM PUSHING IN PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT OUT LUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY IS THE CAUSE OF ISLAM RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T AND YES THE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE EXTREME FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TOOK TO FARMERS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXT THING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE IS USED BY REAL PEOPLE HAVE SOME
TEXTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
LIKE WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN DEATH
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME THINK GRIDLY
YOU HAVEN'T CALLED IT
WE HAVE TO GET CRYING
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP TO SKIES HIS LIFE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT I'VE NEED TO READ AND THEIR WALL STREET JOB HIS BREAKSHINE IN THE FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE ARE THOSE GUNS COMING
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE DEPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOW ABUSED A LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR CO WORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT IN YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS IS HUMAN
ON THE ATTRACTIVE
OUR LAB POTENTIAL AMAZED
WHERE THERE'S SIX PEOPLE DO NOT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD I KNEW
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE HOLDS AND THOUSAND FACES
SOME MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLAYING IT'S SO HARD FOR AND HOW DO WE GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO YOU
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
AND YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
BEHIND THE CATALS OF WAR
WE HEAR SEVERAL REASON
THIS SYNAMIC MATORITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE STYLED
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OKAY THEN WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE LATER GATHER
WE COULD DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTON MISS NO FISH
AS CONVENTION I TRY AND TURN IN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOW WHEN YOU GET DONE THE ANSWER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW OUR PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WEIGHT
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE A CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A WHOLE VISION
IF I WAS A DAY
HOW DOES THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFER FROM ACTION HAVING AN EFFECTIVE IDEA BUT
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
COULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HAVING IT
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOD SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I DON'T NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEE
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
BUT I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS FAT ALL
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES EVOLVED INTERCATE DAY DREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS VERY DEFINITIVE
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
INCREDIBLY PEOPLE ARE WARMING FRIENDLY IN THEIR EYES SO PLAY
WAS GIVING A TAKING ON MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES WHEN YOUR VALUES
WE ARE ATTENTION TO OUR OTHERS
THE SAME SURROUNDED BY BEINGS OF STATES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO THE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THIS WHOLE PROBLEM OF DESIGNED BEING OFTEN THE MISTAKERS SOON FOR ART
DESIGNERS ASPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
BUT WE WANT WHAT WE EXPIRED TO REASON THE CODE
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
BUT THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CANCERS AND THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE ATTRACTIVE
NOW AT THAT TIME CAMBON NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST INTERESTING IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMERA POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A DELLA STICKY THEY WERE RATES OF DENIA AND THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON THE MORE
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBER IN TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OKLAND AIDS AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW TURNS IN
WE TOOK CAMPLING OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST INTERESTED IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS CRAZY BECAUSE WE'RE PROBABLY SAFELY TO BE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DATA COURT
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT NEURONAL FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK TO
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY AND FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
HE IMPACTS SENTENCY
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO EACH OTHERS AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION HOW
AND AT THE UP OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WERE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY'LL LET THE BASEBALL SCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT SANDSCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTRUM THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WOULD YOU TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS A DINNER WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER CARLOS
AND HE WANTED TO SAY WHEN HE COULD STAND THE ROOM WHERE HE COULD THE PLANET HIS DAY BROWSER HE COULD GET HIS HAND
I DIDN'T CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR
IT COULD THE MODEL HELP THEIR
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
I DON'T LOOK THINK FOR AN
I'M NOT SHORT
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M WRITING FOR MANY INTERVIEW
I WAS RIGHT DEALING WITH IT
AND I NEED MY UPGRADE
WE MUST ADAPT THAT WAY OF LIVING BACK
THAT DOES THE PROMINE HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY REPREMANDING
EFFECTIVELY THE DOLLAR PART CREATE A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THAT BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS THAT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE SAYS OTHER ONES
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE UNDER DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE AND TO GET RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OBJECT
WE JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CONSCIOUS
DID YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS TO THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
THE TWO YEARS TO WASH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT VERY TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
THREE BILLION PEOPLE REALLY WERE SELF BORN SCANDICS TO SEE THAT
THEY DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE'RE ALL BEEN BIAS
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW AT ALL
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAIN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER OR
ARTISTURE NEURAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE CANDLES IN THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE OF BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TRUE OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO NOT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY LEADS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE I HEAR RIGHT NOW
WHY IS JANIFICIAN MIDLIFE
OR A FINAL FLYING
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
NO NOT HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERING
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GATE RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN THEY'D NEVER BEEN RECORDED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING YOU KNEW WAS WEIRD OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORLD
YOU ARE HERE AND A SCONAGE VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DIDN'T COME AROUND
AND SO IT WAS PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WILL BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THIS SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IMAGINE
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OBVIOUSLY
THEN SHE DID THE BOSSES TO RAIN OUT RAN OF THE INNOVATIVE THERE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO COMPETITOR MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BREASTER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS THAT GOES BANKRUPT OR BY EFFECTLY TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WANTED THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS IS GETTING WORST DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS OF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST AGREE WITH THIS
THAT WE EVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MEN OR WOMEN
I WANT TO KNOW
IT WAS LIKE OH THEY HAD WAS ON
THEY WERE CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVER
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER HUNDREDS
EVERY KID LIVES IN OUR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
THEY HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WOULD TAKE A JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUSHED MYSELF
IT WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED BY THE MIDDLE BIT
BUT I WOULD GO INTO OCCASION
THAT THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT F
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY ROAD MY RESULT STONE
AND NOW LOVE LANGUAGES
AND YOU KNOW FOR THAT
AND THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANYMORE CARS
I HAD TO HAVE FAILED
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
ISN'T ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WERE
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK A LITTLE BIT PATHY BUT WHAT WAS MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OTHER
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON WE'VE DOT THE BEAST TWO PEACH
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AND YET A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE JAMES
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETITION
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND YOU DOES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS THE POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE THE STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY ONLY KNOW MONEY ELSE
SHE WORKED IN THE BANK
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
WHO CARES ABOUT POLICY
WHICH INSILEY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT OF TYPE
I DON'T BE GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE IT AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GOING
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PARENT
YOU MIGHT GET A PEACE FOR THAT
WELL NOT THAT
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREAKING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS POTHER CHOICE
THAT IS SOME TO DEEP THE TYPE OF EMOTION WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHY
NOW I KNOW WHAT I AM HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG CALLING TO BUY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE DON'T GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENTARY
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
ISN'T ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THE BRAIN CARE FOR ME
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS WHO TURNED TO SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING LOVE MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINALLY QUITE YES
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THE PART OF OUR ATTRACTIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW THEM THE SIGN WITH CANCER IS
WE'VE GOT SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE COP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FOR PLACE TO PLACE
WHERE ARE THE RESEARCHERS ARE LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
AND NO IDEA
I THINK I'M A NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE BOOKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WILL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE WHAT AGAIN IN SCARCE IN THE COMPANY
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY WERE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD A LEVEL CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WORRY YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO WAS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
NOW RIGHT NOW
GOVERNMENT OF FISHERS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME ON LOST
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OF SO GOOD EMOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NO WAYS BACK
WE PUSH A POOL AND BOOK AND BROAD THINGS
I DIDN'T FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY IS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
THAT MOMENT IS
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SHOULD BE OUT MONEY
WE WILL TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST THAT YOU'VE HAD A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR YOURSELF SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T THINK
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING THIS LAB
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAS
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN THE AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU
I SAID A SHAME
I THOUGHT IT EXCEPT DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOUR WIFE LEFT YEAR
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO NOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO CONFORMS OF FEMALE NORMS
AND I'M SORTLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS IN MEDIOCRE STUDENTS
AND THEN SHE NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR NAME IS NOT
THIS IS NON SENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
IT'S ACTUALLY ARRASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
LOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU KNOW AT THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW WHEN SOMEBODY DID FOR ENOU
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WAS SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DON'T WE ENAVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANING
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
NOR MARS HE LOVED
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO HONODIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
WHAT DIFFERENCE IS MADE IF THEY TALK ABOUT YOUR SUNFELL
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL I WANT DIFFERENCES THIS MAKE
AND SO WE NEED TO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HARD UNIQUE
I WANT TO BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
THIS IS NOT TO PUT OUT OF ANYONE
IT IS WHY
IT'S A RESPONSIBLE TO
I WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO THE WELCOMING
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GO A POOR DO YOU WANT TO BE RICH
NOW COULD I LET THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED TOOK FOOD BUT THE WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH IT STUFF FOR
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH COLLING AS TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
THIS WAS ONE I WAS IN TEXIOUS
THEY HAD HER SCAND INSIDE OUT
AND WE LISTEN TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WASN'T BEEN AN INTERVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD YOU MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEANING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS THAT INTERESTS ARE
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING IT WORKED
IS PRETTY COOL
WE HAVE THE PLANET
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WHAT NEXT TO US WORRY ABOUT THINGS
WOMAN STAVE IS COMING UP
WELL LET'S GO ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MAN IT
WELL WHAT CAN I KNOW ABOUT IT
IT'S A LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
HE'S BROKEN TO BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WANT THAT
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MAYORS BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WAS SO AS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE
THAT'S NOT SO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF ENGAGING AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS THAT GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BIGGER MATHI
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND WORK LIKE A KNOW
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFALL
TELL POEM AND THAT
AND THAT'S HOME
THEY WERE ALL WHITE
THOUGH THEY FELT LIVED TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
UNTIL REWARKED THE OTHER
I MAY NEVER HOLD YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME ABOUT
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I HAVE TO WROTE IN MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CALLED INTERVISE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR AND WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE OF BAR
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST OF THE BACK MEETING WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLARGES
BUT THEY DO WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A 10 YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLIND AND IT WASN'T JUST THE WRONG AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORLD
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
I WAS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT THEY CAN LEAD EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY HARMONES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAID EVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
NOW THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE BOSS
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROUTES
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TOO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB OF REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S SOMETHING UNIVER WAYS TO EAT PEACE
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT ADMIT TO WHAT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING A STORY THAT AT THE PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLON ORGANIZATION
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE POSED RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLARS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE STOCKS
THE GROUP SHELLS
BUT NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THEM OUT YET
THERE WAS NO WORLD BAB
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT DONE DOWN THAT WORLD
LIFE IS A GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN USER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SOLVES
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T KN
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE ATTRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS CROWING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I LOOK WHY
WHAT ABOUT SURE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRILLIANT IT WARNERS BECAUSE THE WASHER IN DRYING OR ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT GOING TO PROBABLY SAMPLE
YOU CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT COMPANY
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT PUT THEM
WHY NOT JUST THAT BUSINESSES CAN BE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENVIRONMENTAL PARTNERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKLY ORCHING
HOW WAS IT MADE
WHY WAS THAT AMAZED
THEY DON'T FEEL AT HOME
