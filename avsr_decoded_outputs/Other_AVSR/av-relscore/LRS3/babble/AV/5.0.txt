WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKEN BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE COMNESS AND
I AM NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
I SAID WHAT YOU MEAN
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM
BLOCKS HAVE NAMES
WILL YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERFUME
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN THIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WE'RE GOING TO EAT THESE COWS
THEY'RE NOT BEING SHIPPED UP HERE
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL
IT'S NOT ELECTRIC
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE OF GALLS
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED SENT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
WHO ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE ANTIGRIM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT PROBABLY WON'T
SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FAMINE CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE SONS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WON'T NAME NAMES BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUO TODAY
OF JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATIONALISTIC
THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THAT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE MISSING GUYS
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND THEN AT 11 AND CLOCK THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LITLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WE'RE THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR AND WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WEREN'T
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUTREACHED PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
IS THIS COMPLETELY BIZARRE
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP CITY HALL
I'M NOT A MILITARY BRACK
THEY SIGNED IT BECAUSE THEY WANT A SOME FORM OF A VENGE
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOOD STREAM
I WANT TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION
DOES YOU FIND A GOAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WANT THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LIFE
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
AND MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU SAW HIM ACT
WE DON'T USE AUDIO WE DON'T CHOOSE VIDEO
HOW ARE YOU
THE BOYS REMINDED ME OF HOME
I DON'T WANT TO
I SAID IN ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GET TO DO THAT
THEY HAD HIT THE JACK POT
LIFE IS COULD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND THE
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORRIBLE DISEASES
WHAT ARE POLIO
LET'S HAVE THAT
NO ONE'S EVER SET THAT BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THEM IN
IT HAS TO STOP
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE GISSUING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
HOW SAT ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE OF TRIVIAL MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH SHARE IT IN
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE RARE GAME CHANGES REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF AT LEAST
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT IS
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
IT WAS SOMETHING WAS WRONG
IS IT GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAD TO CELEBRATE
IRRECONCYLABLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT ARE CONTRADICTION
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB TITLE TO BE HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
THIS IS THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MORE SLAW TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A WALK THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
SHE WOULD HIDE IN THE CLOSET
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN YOUR DOG GETS OUTSIDE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DARK IS GETTING
HIS NAME IS LONNIHAD AND HE'S A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
WILL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A BEAR
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR ON TERROR
YOU DON'T GET CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF FIRST 10 PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THERE WERE NO BACKDOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
THIS'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAN REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE USE
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANY MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S MOBILE MANIPULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FORMING A QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD HAPPEN TO A WORKFORCE
I TACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
WHO WROTE THAT
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
THE KEY HERE REALLY IS KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD TO DO THINGS SOMETIMES
AND BOY THEY WERE LIKE WHAT
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN
IT'S ALMOST BECOMING THE SINK TAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD USE
THIS IS WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IT IS NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL GOHESION
DID YOU HEAR HE HAS GONE MAD
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND IT'S THIS REALLY THE SOLUTION
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS A FATAL RECIPE
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS ALONES EVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 SENIOR EFFICIENTS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO IN ALL OF THIS
I'M INVENTED SEVERAL YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE
AND WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT TO STAND THE RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE GOING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY ARE WE SKIPPING OVER THIS
I WENT TO THE DEAN
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S SUNLIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW KNO
AND THAT LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
WE'VE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHEN THE CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I COULD
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE MAGIC
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 EMAILS
MY OWN WEBSITE
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW I'VE WRITTEN DOWN TO MY
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WHAT'S THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
AND HE'S THE BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT
WELL YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
THE GAS THAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
AND SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
SO WHAT IS AN IDEA DRAWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
YOU'RE ALL COLLECTIVE
AND IF IT'S A COMPLETELY OKAY WHAT'S THE JOKE
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE ALL HAD DONE THIS
WHEN IT'S 10 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
THEIRS LOVE AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND THEIRS PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
COULD WE EMERGE
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THANKS FOR ASK IN A
I SAID WHERE IS YOU NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RESPECT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMEN'S FEMINISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADSTRONG BRILLIANT GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKE ME WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO TO BREAK A GIRL
I LEARNED TO RIGHT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST NEED SUCH BRAVERY
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMICS
IT'S A TOP PREDATIVE
I LOVE RED ONE
I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
I MADE MORE MONEY
WAS GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BALLOOPLANET OUR WORLD BANK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
IT WANTS A TREATMENT
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
WHY NOT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THREE
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN AS A CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOU'RE IN THERE
BUT THE SECOND OF THE CHANCE EMISSIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSFORMATIONS WE HAVE TO DECIDE TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO BE WRONG IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE COM
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH US SOMETHING AS WEL
AND IN THAT I NEED A SURGERY LEXICON
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER OF DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
WHO OR WHAT INSPIRES YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMEN FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
THIS IS A ONLY PART THAT'S BATTERY BACKED UP
AND JERNED MEAN FRIENDS
FOUR TIMES THE MASSIVE THE SUN
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO TOPPLE DICTATORS
I WAS TERRIFIED
WHAT IS WE'RE DYING FOR
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHINGWITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE HERE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY ROCKET SCIENCE
LET'S CHANGE THE WAY WE TALK
THE POINT OF THAT
HAD NO IDEA
THEY DON'T TRUST THE LAW
WHY DON'T THEY TRUST ALONG
IT'S NOT TRUE
THAT WAS ONLY WAY TO GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT EFFICIENT
EFFICIENCY IS FOR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN MY DAD
MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY SCARED TO MOVE
I'M TRYING TO BECOME BETTER PERSON
EVEN ONE IS SO HARD
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO MENTORING
IS IT THAT I RIGHT REALLY WELL
WE QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGED KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST CRUSHING POVERTY WIDENING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE AND DEFINED COMPARTMENTS THESE DAYS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WILL BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW IF SUCCEED
I HADN'T BADE IN THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS I KNOW COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE IN NUTRITION
A DIGITAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
AND THIS IS HEAD DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM A NATION
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE DID
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT NATA
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS INTO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOT LINE
THE NAZISH INVADED THE NETHERLANDS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY B B GUN
IT WAS LIKE A STAR CHECK UP SO YOU KNOW
I STARTED OPEN UGANDA
WELL NOT YOUR BEST
I'M AT TWO SONG
WE HAVE TO DRAW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SET AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROW
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL RIDING
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICANS HOME BROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILL TO POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN HISTOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE ARE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE SPEAKY TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 PIECES OF NASTY EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
AND IN FACT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES BUT
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE END
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S UP TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ MANY SELF HELD BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT HUMILITY
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS FOR YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU
WHO'S THE EVENT
WHATEVER IT IS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
IT WAS A PAULING
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR HUME
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVE FOR ME
I AM TORN BY YOUR LOVE FOR ME
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPENT MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
YOU'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WORK
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCORE
BUT IT'S USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO READ AND WRITE IT
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN NEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
THE SUPREME COURT HAS FALLEN WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE WHOLE SITES
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAD TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOKED THE SAME LINDER A MICROSCOPE I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
NOW TRUE IS THAT
NOW HAMLETON WAS EVERYTHING MEDICINE WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE GOOD OLD FASHION WAY
FIRST THEY FOUNDED POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT SEE I'D EYE
HOW FLAR AWAY WAS THE FINISH LINE
SO THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
BUT THIS REALS IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
DO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO AND THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CARO CELL
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WHAT AM I THINKIN
WHAT'S FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY DIFFERENT INTEREST
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANNEL
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BRINGSTONE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
AND SHE'S LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
ANY THINGS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF A MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
IT WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FEMINIST
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED AS I AM
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITOR THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS HAD EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB WILL
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLUDE OUR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORST
I'M SO SORRY
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AN OPERA ALL NIGHT LONG
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVES YOU
I'M IN THE CRUCIBLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 PERCENT OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FIGHT
SHE GOT A SUPPORT NETWORK
SHE LEARNED ABOUT HER RIGHTS
HE WAS DOING OKAY
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SETTLE OF CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUGGLING A SNOWBALL ACROSS THE TROUBLES
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ON
IT'S A COMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER AID FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FROM THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORKED FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WELL SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WHICH BROUGHT US TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS IN A VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
DID THEY HAVE AGED
DO THEY HAVE A COMMON COLD
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID AND THAT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I SHOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
CO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT DAILY FIRES TO THINK AHEAD STRAGICALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS ISN'T INFORMATION
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT SO COMPLICATED ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT HE MISSES
WE HAVE TO ANSWER THAT
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF THEM GOT OUT OF THE ARMY IT HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN IT HAD NO CHOICE
JUST WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO D
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO FOR REALLY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THIS IS HOW STUFF IS MADE MEMORABLE
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USABLE
I WILL CRAFT MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
WE MORE WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN LOSES HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPS HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TWO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACED WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE CURVES SPIRAL
CLUSTER BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
THEY WILL SIT IN THEM FOREVER
OF THOSE SEVEN HAVING UCLEAR WEAPONS
I AM PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT ON LUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED THE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TALK TO FARMERS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE IS USED BY REAL PEOPLE HAS THEM
TEXTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND TO THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME THINK CRITICAL
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED IT
WE HAVE TO GET CRIET
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DISGUISED AS LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEAGUE DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB AND HIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOW ABUSE THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR CO WORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
AND I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT IN YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS IS TRUE
ARE THEY ATTRACTIVE
ARE THE A POTENTIAL MADE
WHEN YOU'RE SIX MAYBE YOU DO THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOLDEN 10000 FACES
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
AND YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE HEAR THE CHAOS OF WAR
WE HEAR TERRORISM
THE SYLUM MAJORITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENT
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OKAY AND WE COULD MAKE A MOBILE GAGGER COUNTER
WE CAN DRIVE AROUND
WE CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTON MISS NO FISH
AS AN INVENTOR I TRY AND TURNED FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S HOME THE SHELTER
FIVE PERCENT TODAY
HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFERE FROM ACTUALLY HAVING AN EFFECTIVE AD CAMP
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
COULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOLS SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE'D LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEET
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATE DAYDREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS VERY DEFINITIVE
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAPPY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY THEY'RE NICE THEY'RE POLITE
WHEREAS GIVING AND TAKING OUR MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES WHERE YOUR VALUES
WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS TOWARD OTHERS
THE SAM SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO THE
I WAS STARTING A BIT INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THIS WHOLE PROBLEM OF DESIGN BEING OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD FOR ART
DESIGNERS ASPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
BUT WE WANT WHAT WE ASPIRED TO IS THE CODE
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
AND THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE ATTRENTED
NOW AT THAT TIME CAMDEL NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMELON POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE LOW STICKY AND THEY WOULD WRITE SOMETHING ON AND THEY WOULD PUT IT UP ON A BOARD
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OKLAND AIDS AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
WE TOOK CAMEDON OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY AND COURT
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARTILE FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IT IMPACTS SENTENCING
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BUY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION OUT
AND AT THE OP OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY'RE LIKE THE BASEBALL SCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS
WILL YOU TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
REMEMBER CARLOS
HE WANTED TO SIT WHERE HE COULD SCAN THE ROOM WHERE HE COULD PLAN ESCAPE BROWSE WHERE HE COULD GET HIS HANDS
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP ME
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
I DON'T LOOK THERE FRIEND
I'M NOT SHORT
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY END OF YOU
I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH YET
IT GET MY UPGRADE
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBABLY HAPPEN EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY REPREMANDED
EFFECTIVELY THE DARLIE BOND CREATE A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
YOU JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE COSTIOUS
DID YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS TO THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS AT HOME
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
TREE BILLION PEOPLE TODAY WITH CELL PHONES CAN'T TAXES INTERNET
DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE ARE ABOUT BIAS
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT THEY ARE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
HARDEST THEIR INTERNAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END TO SEE THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH THEM
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
WHY IT DOES A JELLYFISH AND MIDLIGHT
OR A FLY OR FLY
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
NO NOT HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERAGE
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAY RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD EVER BEEN RECORDED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE IS OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE A HEALER IN A STONE AGE VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DID COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WON'T BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THEIR BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AN INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS THAT GOES BANKRUPT OR BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE BAD IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
LIKE WE EVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN OR WOMAN
I WANT TO GO
I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVER DOING
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE TAKING JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WOULD NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER IT WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
BUT I WOULD GO IN ON OCCASION
AND I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT 
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY GROWN MY RESETTA STONE
AND NOW I LOVE LANGUAGES
I KNOW NOTHING
AND THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANYMORE CARS
I HAD TO HAVE PHASE
IT WOULD BE A MALL AND NOT A PARK
IS IT ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POVERTY BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IT'S SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OTHER
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON WE'VE GOT TO BEAST TO TEACH
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE TABLE
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETITIVE ISSUE
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE IN A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
SHE WORKED IN A BANK
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
WHO CARES ABOUT BOSNIA
WHICH INSTANTLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT TIME
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
YOU MIGHT GET IN PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A READING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER TOURISA
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHEN YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THAT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHY
NOW I KNOW WHY I AM HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG IN YOUR BODY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT DRINK
IS IT ABOUT SYSTEMS
IS IT ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CARE FOR ME
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING OIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW DEEP INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS
I KNOW I DID IT
I THINK I'M A NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARCE AT A HOPE THAT
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY WERE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WORN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO WAS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
NOW RIGHT NOW
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND POOL AND POOL AND BROAD THINGS
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY AS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
CAME ON MEN
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SMELL MONEY
WE WERE TOLERATE THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR THE SALE OF SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY DID YOU BRING THIS UP
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAN
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON A AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I STUDIED SHAME
I GUESS I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOUR WIFE LEFT YEAR
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TOKNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO CONFORM TO FEMALE NORMS
I AM CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS A MEDIOCRE STUDENT
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR IN AMAZON
THIS IS NOT SENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
NOW DOES SOME DIFFERENT THAT
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANING
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FURTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LIVE
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF THEY TALK JURY SIGN FELT
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFFERENT IS THIS MAKE
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HARD UNIQUE
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THIS IS NOT TO PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GROW A POOR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW COULD I LET THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH AT STANFORD
I'M A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING AGE TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RITUAL
THIS IS WHEN I WAS IN TEXIOUS
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OUT
I WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WAS A BIT UNCONVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO TO THAT BOARD MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS THAT INTEREST
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
PRETTY COOL
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMAN'S DAY WAS COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MALE TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGE
THAT'S NOT SO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONTAGION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS THAT GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BIGGER MATTLEY
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND WORKED LIKE A DOLL
THAT'S YOUR GRANDFALL
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S ALL
THEY WERE ALL RIGHT
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
AND THEN WE WORKED TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY OUT
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER AND I HAVE DEVOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE SAID A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN FLORID
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST INDEPENDENT MEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKAGES
BUT LINDA WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A 10 YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE THROWN OUT
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE IN MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRANK AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORK
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM AT THE HEATING EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WEIGH
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAID EVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT GOD KNOWS ME
AND I THOUGHT WE SHOULD STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MASK
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROOTS
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB BRIDGE AND THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S SOMETHING IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO EAT PETS
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT ADMIT TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING HISTORIC THEN AT THE RECEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLIB ORGANIZATION
YOU KNOW THEY DO POLES RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLLS
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP GELS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROAD MAP
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN LOSER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SUCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T KN
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE A TRIBE ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I WAS LIKE WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING ANY QUARTERS BECAUSE THE WASHER AND DRYER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THIS PRETTY STRUCTURE
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROBABLE SAMPLE
YOU CAN NAVIGATE SPACE
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBER
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST LET BUSINESSES CAN BE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENCES TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENFORCED IN PARTNERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING ORGIN
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT MADE
THEY FEEL AT HOME
