WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT FOR THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
AND HE SAID I'M THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKING BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT ONE IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TELL
IT'S USING THE PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEANING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M A TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE COMMNESS AND
BUT I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL DUNTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THING FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
HE SAID WHAT WE NEED
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY YOU
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR ANY
BLOCKS HAPPEN NEWS
BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK BATTLE
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE AN OVER
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN THIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WE'RE GOING TO MEET THESE COWS
THE NOTHING SHOULD THAT BE ABLE
IT'S NOT QUITE SURE THAT'S
IT'S A MATTER WHAT SHOWS
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
HE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MEAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHERE DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO MUSIC GALAXY
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED TO AT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
WHO ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE ANCIENT GROUND AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT THEY PROBABLY WANT
SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FAMINE CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON IT
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDIED HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVEN'T BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE THOUGHTS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PART OF THE SAME SPECIES
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WILL NAME NAMES BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR WOULD THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
IT MEANS BUT
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUO TO IT
THAT IS JUST SIX PEOPLE
YES IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
WE SHOULDN'T BE NATURALISTICAL
THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THAT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM HAS TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL
DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
BUT IT'S NOT COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE MESSY DIES
BUILDINGS CAN BE RIGHT PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND THEN AT 11 IT CLUCK THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR WHO ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY WENT
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF I WOULD REACH PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IT MEANS
IS THIS CONDREAM DESIRE
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP CITY HARM
A LOT OF MILITARY ROCKING
THEY SIGN IT BECAUSE THEY WANT SOMETHING THEY GO BENCH
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL POINT
ARE YOU VISITING COMBINED
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE IN THE CENTER OF POTENTIAL
HE'S FINE A GOAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WON THE GAME
SO MERE WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BEAT ME WHY
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
MAYBE WE FEEL SMART
YOU SAW HIM AT I
WE DON'T JUST HOLD YOU WE DON'T JUST VADIO
HOW ARE YOU
THE VOICE REMINDED ME OF HOME
I DIDN'T WANT TO
I SAID IN THE ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT WHO GET TO DO THAT
THEY HAD HIT THE JACK PARTY
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
AND YOU UNDERSTAND
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
YOU TAKE THEM AWAY DISEASE COMES BACK HORRIBLE DISEASES
WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU
LET'S TELL THAT
WOMAN TO WAS SET OUT BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THE MAN
THE CAST OF THE STOCK THE
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE THE MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH IS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE ISSUING WORDS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY I
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
HOW SAT ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE A TRIVIAL MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW AND ALL SERIOUS IS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
FROM WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
WE DON'T DO MUCH SHARING
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE RARE DAMN CHANGES REQUIRES YOU TO PULL OFF AT LEAST
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT MEANS
I HAVE TO TAKE A YEAR OFF
I'M TALKING ABOUT TWO TRUTHS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG
IS IT GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE ADD TO CELEBRATE
YOU'RE RECONCILED IN LIFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE BLESSED WITH PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT A CONTRADICTION
OTHER LIFE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB TITLE TO BE HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1836 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
BECAUSE THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T EVEN WORSE A LOT OF CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
BUT WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANPATH PROJECT ON THE TOP OF MARTIFICIAL TELEVISIONS
IT PRACTICED OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A LOT THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T EAT
SHE WOULD HIDE IN THE POSIT
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN THE DOG GETS OUTSIDE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DOG IS GETTING
HIS NAME IS LAUNNING BRAJ AND HE'S A VETERAN VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATED STRESS ACTIVATION
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A VAN
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR OF TERROR
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
ONE OF THEM GOT CALLED UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS SAYING LOOKING MORE THINGS I
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE HAVE THE SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS AMAZING IT WAS A
THERE WERE NO BACKDOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAN REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE LAW
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE USE
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S MODEL OF MANIPULATION
I LOVED THEIR OWN ROBOTS
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE FORMING A QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD TAP INTO A WORKFORCE
I TACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I'M GOING TO GET ME A LITTLE BIT
WHO WROTE THAT
ON EACH YOU THERE
THE KEY HERE REALLY IS KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DIDN'T EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD A NEW THING SOMETIMES
AND WHO THEY WERE LIKE ONE
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
SO HOW WAS BECOMING THE SYNTAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD USE
THIS IS WHAT I'M FULL TO NATURALLY ABLE TO DO
WHY IS IT NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT'S OF COURSE CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
DID YOU HEAR HE HAS GONE MATH
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT MEANS TOO HAPPEN
I HAVE RESOURCES
IT IS THIS REALLY DISSIGNATION
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS TO PUT THIS IF THEY TRADE A RECIPE
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED FOR THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS ALONES INVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 SIMILAR VISIONS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR PLANET
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO WITH
WHAT CAN WE DO IN ALL OF THIS
I'M 27 YEARS OLD
AND THAT'S MORE RESPONSIBLE
WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT TO STAND THIS RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE GOING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAT TO DO ME
WHY ARE THE SKIPPING OVERS
I WENT TO THE DAMN
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
THERE'S HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHEN THE CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I COVERED
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VENUE
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I'VE BUILT A CAREER
WE IMAGINE
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 MELLS
YOU MAY HAVE A WEBSITE
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN THE CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW I'D WRITTEN DOWN SOMEONE
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
IT'S THIS QUITE TALKING ABOUT
LET ME ILLUSTRATE THIS
AND HE'S A BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE FULL TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT AND
WELL LET ME GET SEVERAL THINGS
AND WE GUESS WHAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WITH OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
WELL WHERE IS AN IDEA GROWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
YOU ARE ALL COLLECTIVE
AND THE FIRST PEOPLE WE OTELL YOU WHAT'S THE JOB
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE GOT TO DONE THIS
WHEN IT'S 10 DEGREES FOLLOW ZERO
OF LOVE AND THEIR S FRIENDSHIP AND THERE'S PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARRIAGE AND CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF HUMAN THERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
COULD WE MERGE
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP BY HUMILIATION
THAT'S FRESH GOING TO
HE SAID WHERE IS YOU NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GUYS
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THAT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER DAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION THAT DISEASE AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVING THEM WITH FEMINISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADSTRONG BRAIN AND GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKEN WHEN I WAS SO YOUNG I DID NOT KNOW WHAT BOYS CAN DO TO BREAK A GIRL
I LEARNED TO RIGHT LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE THIS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST NEED SUCH BRAVERY
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
A LOT OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL PENGUINS
IT'S A TOP RETINA
THAT'S ONE RADIO
I'M HERE IT WAS SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW LINE IMPACT WHEN I'M A
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY INFECT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
WHEN THEY MORE NIGHT
IT'S GREAT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR BLUE PLANET AND ON THE WORLD BANK
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TAG EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
IT WON'T BE TREATED
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
WE MIGHT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD AND
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND HE SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS AND MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE INCLUDING THROUGH
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS BROWN AS A CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOU'RE IN THERE
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSFORMATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSPORTATIONS WE HAVE TO BE SAYING TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
DON'T EMIR ON IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE COMEDY IN THE M
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH SOMETHING AS WELL
AND IN THAT I NEED A CERTAIN NEXT DAY
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO THE WEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER DIGITAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
THINK OR WHAT INSPIRES YOU AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY WOMEN'S FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
IS WEARING TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GROWTH LEVEL
THIS IS THE ONLY PART THAT'S BETTER BACKED UP
AND JAIME AND FRIENDS
4 TIMES THE MASS OF THE SUN
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH WE
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO TOPPLE DICTATORS
I WAS TERRIFYING
WHAT IS WE DYING FOR
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN'T CHANGE OUR MINDS
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE ROCKET SCIENCE
IT'S CHANGING WHERE WE TALK
WE'RE DOING THAT
HAD NO IDEA OF
THEY DON'T TRUST TO LOVE
WHY DON'T WE COME FROM ALL
IT'S NOT TRUE
THAT WAS ONLY WAY TO GET ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S A BUILDABLE RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT EFFICIENT
EFFICIENCY IS FOUR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WORK
THAT'S WHAT HAPPEN WITH MY DAD
MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
THEY GET SCARED TO MOVE
I'M TRYING TO BECOME A BETHER PERSO
PEOPLE WANT IT SO FAR
WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE IS IT RELATES MENTORING
IS IT THAT I AM RIGHT VERY WEARING
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GASED FRESH AND POVERTY WHITE THEY
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IN DEFINE COMPARTMENT TO THESE THINGS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO THINGS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT FOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAIN TO TUNE OUT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
THEY DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOOTPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE IT SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WOULD BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION WILL BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW I SUCCEED
I HADN'T BAID IN THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WINNING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
NACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS' PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS I KNOW COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE IN NUTRITION
THE INGENERAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T HE JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS CALLED THE REST
THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW CAN I COME FROM THE BEACH
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE THESE
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU BID
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT ME IT
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WHO WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS AND TO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE FOR LOCK A ROOM AND GIVING THEM
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ME ONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WITHOUT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT TOP LINE
THE NAZIS INFRADED THE NETHERLANDS
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN OUR HOUSE WITH MY VIDEO GAME
IT WAS LIKE A STAR TREK OF SOME YOU KNOW
I STARTED OPEN ME GONE TO
WELL THAT'S THE BEST
I'M IN TUCSON
WE HAVE TO GO AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
MY OTHER GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO AND SET AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWD
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITING
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO BE STARTED OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICANS HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILL TO POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN HISTOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YOU
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 MISSES OF NASTY EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAY PLACE
THEN WHAT DID HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CAN HAPPEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO ME IT'S NOT THAT CLEAR
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN LOCAL PLACES WITH
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF YEARS
THAT'S JUST A WRONG
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
WHAT WE'VE BEEN BRINGING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT FALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE END AND
WE KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S OUT TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ THAT HIS HEALTH HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT A MILLION
TRY IT AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS WITH YOU
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR SOMETHING
LOSE AT THE EFFECT
WHATEVER IT WAS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WERE BORN THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
IT WAS A PART OF THE
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR HUMAN
I REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF MEN
I AM TORNED BY YOUR LUFFING
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LIFE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING THEIR TECHNOLOGIES
WE'VE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW TO TURE THIS WORLD
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCORE
IT IS USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO READ A DAY
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE FAILS
NO ONE OF LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF QUARRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULDN'T QUITE THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
THE SUPREME COURT HAS FALLEN AWAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE HOLY SENSE
THEY ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN MAY HAVE TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LOOKED AT STAND WITH OUR MICROSCOPE I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW COOL IS THAT
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING MADISON WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN THE BIT OF FASHION WAY
FIRST THEY FOUNDED POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TO BE
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT SEE BY THE EYE
HOW FAR AWAY WAS THE FINISH LINE
SO THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
BET THIS REALS AND BOST IN
THERE'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
DID THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB
THROUGH OUR NEW EXTERNAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST AN INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BAGS FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROSELVES
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WHAT MY THINKING
I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANNEL
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BRINSTONE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
IN SHE WAS LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LANES TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDERS TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WANT RULE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT YOU'LL RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BEING UPDATED
IT CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF THE MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK AS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE A BIN
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL ME A FILMIST
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED AS I AM
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS IT EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB WILL
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE WORST
AND SALSAR
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MAY IT WORK FOR ME
AND THEY PUT ON AND OFF WITH ALL NIGHT HOME
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
WE DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT MOVES YOU
I'M IN THE POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 OF THEM ARE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FATHER
SHE GOT AND SUPPORT NETWORKS
YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOUR PRICE YOU
YOU'RE DOING OBVIOUS
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
DON'T WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE AROUND SUTHERN CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE WON THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUGGLING THE SNOWBALL ACROSS THE PROBLEMS
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE START POINTS OF EATING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ON
IT'S AT COMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARY IN THE WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER AID FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS CAN HAPPEN
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIND ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN I DEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKETS TRACKING TECHNOLOGY FOR THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WILL SINCE WE WERE A KID REALLY
WE'VE BROUGHT US TO THIS
WHAT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS OF TESTS THAT ARE VERY SMALL PLACE
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THAT THEY HAVE AGED
DO THEY HAVE A COMMON COLD
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARD CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRED
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL
I SHOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THAT
GO PICK UP THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUR DAILY FIRES TO THINK YOU HAVE STRAGICALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS ISN'T INFORMATION WE
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO COMPLICATED ABOUT BORN
IT WAS INCREDIBLY LIE
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT HE DRESSES
WE HAVE TO ANSWER THAT
THE BOYS ARE UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOMEONE WHO GOT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD SOME MENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT ALL OF
I MEAN AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
BUT THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN HE HAD NO CHOICE
JUT WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO WE'RE
AND WE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO THE REALLY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE COULD OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
DO YOU MEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THIS IS HOW STUFF IT MADE MEMORY
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND MUSICAL
I WOULD CRAFT MY OWN JUMP
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
THEY MOURNED WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I MEMBER IT WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN WHO IS HER HEAD
ONE WOMAN FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPS HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TWO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACED WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE CURVES SPIRAL
PLUS THE BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TO BACKLE
SO AFTER 25 YEARS I BEGAN TO FEEL AS IF I WAS RUNNING DRIVE
THEY WERE SITTING NEW FOREVER I
OF THOSE SEVEN HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
I'M PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T BEING ASKED THE
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TALK TO FARMERS
CASMOS SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE REDUCED BY REAL PEOPLE HAS SOME
TEXTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO KNOW ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND WITH A DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO CRITICALLY
I HAVEN'T CURRENT IT
WE HAVE TO GET THE QUIET
AND HOW CAN YOU DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRACK DISGUISED AS THOUGH ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT I BELIEVE DEGREE IN THE WALL STREET JOB IN HIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE DEPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOWED USE THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
AND I GOT BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HELPED WALKED OVER ME
BROUGHT HIM YOUNGER BANDON
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND IF IT'S TRUE
I'VE BEEN ATTRACTED
I WOULD THINK IT'S NOT MADE
WHEN THERE WERE SIX YEARS AGO THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS DOING A WRONG BODY
HOW OLD I DO THE
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL DIFFERENT THOUSAND PATIENTS
SO WE'LL MENTION IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU'RE PLAYING IT'S SO HARD FOR HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
OF YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE HEAR THE CHAOS OF WAR
WE HEAR TURN ON THIS AND
THE SILENT MAJORITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENT
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OK THEN WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE BAGGER ABOUT HER
YOU CAN DRIVE AROUND
YOU CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO PLANTON IS NO FISH
AS AN INVENTOR I TRY AND TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW OUR PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEW
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A HOMO SHELTER
5 PERCENT A DAY
IT KNOWS THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM HAVING AN EFFECTIVE AT EMPTY
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
COULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HAVING
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOLS SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I'M NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEE
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ALL THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATE DAYDREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS VERY DEFINITE IN
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAFTIVE PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
AGREEABLE PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY ARE NICE BUT THEY LIKE
WHEREAS GIVING IT TAKING A MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES AND YOUR VALUES
WHAT YOUR ATTENTION TOWARD OTHERS
THEY SAY I'M SURROUNDED BY BIRDS OF SNAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S FOR YOU WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTION THAT WE'VE HAD TO THE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THIS WHOLE PROBLEM OF DESIGN BEING OFTEN AS UNDERSTOOD FOR ART
DESIGNERS ASPIRE TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
WHAT WE WANT WHAT WE ASPIRE TO USE THE COLD
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET ON THE COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVE
AND THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES OF THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE AND TRENDED
NOW AT THAT TIME CANDY THE JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CAMPAIGN RELEASE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND IT WOULD TAKE A RELOW STICKY AND THEY'D WRITE SOMETHING ON IT AND THEN PUT IT UP ON A BOARD
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OPEN AIDS AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF THE JERSEY
WE TOOK CAMDON OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST AS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE POET SAFETY TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET WE'RE CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY IN PORN
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARNOLD FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME AT
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
BUT IMPACT SENTENCING
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY IN THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE AND WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION AT A
AND AT THE OFF OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY LIKE THE BASEMOSCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTRATE THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST FEEL LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS
WOULD YOU TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST CAUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
IT NEVER CALL US
WE WANTED TO SIT WHERE HE COULD SCAN THE ROOM OR BECAUSE HE PLANNED ESCAPE GROUSEWORK HE COULD GET HIS HANDS
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP ME
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
I DON'T LOOK AT PLANNING
I'M NOT SHORT
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY YOUNG VIEW
I WAS RIGHT THERE LIKE THAT
DID I GET MY UPGRADE
WE MUST ADAPT THAT WAY OF GETTING BACK
THAT SOMETHING PROBABLY HAPPENED EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND BIOLAGING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY RECOMMENDED
EFFECTIVELY THE THORIBAN CREATES A COMPLETE BLACKUP OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE A
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SNOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
WE JUST MOVE AWAY
YOU'RE MORE CAUTIOUS
AND HE WALKED AROUND AND IT QUITES THE THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
DID YOU LEARN TO WATCH YOUR HANDS AT WHOLE
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE ASK
THREE BILLION PEOPLE PLAY WITH CELL PHONES CAN'T ACCESS IN PLANET
DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE HAVE THE BIAS
YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT MAY ARE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAIN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
HARNESS YOUR INTERNAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END OF SEE THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE FOLLOWING IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DAY FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH ME
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
PLEASE SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES A JELLY PATIENT MADE LIGHT
OR A FIREFLY
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
NOW NOT HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T CARE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE COVERAGE
AND OTHERS PRESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN THE GATE RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAT HAD EVER BEEN RECORDED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WERE US OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE HEALER IN A STONING VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DIDN'T COME AROUND
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
FOR WHAT THE SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITY IS COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO WE KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE LIKE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER MY JOB I JUST UPGRADE MY BRANDOTHER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS TO GOES BANKRUPT WHO ARE BY FAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE THAT IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF THE NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS GREAT UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
BUT WE INVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN ALONE
I WANT TO GO
HE WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYTHING
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES OF SIMILAR OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES IN YOUR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLITICIAN GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WOULD TAKE A JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER IS SOMETHING GETS SCARED ME TO THE GIMMING
AND I WOULD GO IN ON OCCASION
AND THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FU
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY WHOLE EGO AND MY WAS AT STEP
AND NOW I LOVE THE ARCTICS
I HAD NOTHING
AND THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANYMORE CARS
I HAD TO HAVE FAITH
IT WOULD BE A MALL AMOUNT OF PARK
IS ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS IT POSSIBLY CAN'T
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL CAPITAL BUT WHAT WE LOOK MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IS SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE CATE TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE OF IT
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT THE BEES TO TEACH IT
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO THE JANE
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETITIVE ISSUE
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN UP
AND WHO IS THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
AND IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT IS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE THIS STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
SHE WORKED IN THE BANK
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
CARES ABOUT POSITIVE
WHICH INCINNALLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
THINK OF A WAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT GO AWAY
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
AM I GOING TO PIECE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREADING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS OTHER CHOICE
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION THAT YOU WANT TO DO IT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE FORCES
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I AM HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
THE IRONY WAS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
AND BUT I FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG IN YOUR BODY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING THE MOMENT AND
IT WAS ABOUT SYSTEMS
IS IT ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THEM REALLY CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS DRIVING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING BLOODY GUESS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE YOU PART OF OUR IRRATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SIDE WITH THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE NOTICED THROUGH THE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE POP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHAT ARE THE RESEARCHERS IN LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS I
I KNOW I DIDN'T
I SAID I'M A MOMENT PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL I GOT SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARCE AND HELPING
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY AREN'T WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WHITE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
NOW RIGHT NOW W
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW CAN WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE NOTION
YOU WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH IN COOL AND COOK AND BOD FACT
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY AS THE ONE THAT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
THAT ONE MAN
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
HE FELL MONEY
WE NEED TO FOLLOW IT THAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR THE SALE OF SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA AND
SHE SAID YEAH
WHY DID YOU BRING THIS UP
HAVE YOU WOSHED YOUR MIND
ON A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAN
IT'S A BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON THE AIRPLANE
WHAT DID WE DO THAT
I SAID THE SHAME I
I THOUGHT YES I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW I'M
YOU WISE LAST YEAR
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WHEN WE NEED TO DO TO CONFORM TO FEMALE ONES
AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT HARDEST WORKING
I WAS A MEDIOCRE STUDENT
IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTMENT WHO WAS ON
THIS IS NONSENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL ALASTMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE RIGHT
THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT T
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED MY OWN USE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANINGS
THROUGH UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT CLOSE FARTHER
OR WHEREAS HE LIVED
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEAKS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN IN
WHAT DIFERENCE DOESN'T MAKE IF THEY TALK ABOUT DURING SIG
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THIS EGG
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO BROADER
WHAT MAKES THE HEART WEAK
I WILL BE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THIS IS NOT A PUTDOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO OUR COMMENT
BUT IT'S DEREFINE
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GROW UP FOUR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW COULD I LOOK ME DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED THE GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH THAT STANFORD
AND PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING ISH TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING A RICH FROM
THIS WAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OUT
AND WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WASN'T THAT UNCONVENTIONALLY
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO AND
SO YOU WANT TO ROAD TO THAT COURT MEETING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE BITS OF THE INTEREST
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHEN WE GET
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING IT WORK
IT'S PRETTY COLD
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMAN STEEL IS COMING UP
WELL LET'S GO ON AT THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU'RE BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AT THAT
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK MALE TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WAS SOLDIES INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGED
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL HER
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONTAGION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN THE FRANAMA
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSTANT BAKER MODEL
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND MORE TRICK AT ALL
THAT'S YOUR BRAND TAUGHT ME
TELL HER THEY'D BET
AND THAT'S ALL
THEY WERE ALL TRIGHT
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
AT THE NEW WORK TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOME
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGY AND RESEARCHER AND I HAVE TO VOTED MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANT
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR IS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE'S AT A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE OF FAR AT
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST OF THE PENAMEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKAGES
THE BLINDER WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE FROM THEM
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENT
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRONE A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORK
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT THEY NEEDED EARTH BREAK
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HEART NEW WAY
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMINGS THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT LIVE KNOWS ME
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE BOSS
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROUTES
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TOO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A MOVING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S A MILLIONARY ONE WAYS TO EAT PEA TO
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT DIMENSION TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT IS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING HISTORIC THAT AT THE PERCEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION
YOU KNOW THEY DO CODES RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO DOES POLES
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THE GROUP GELS
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROAD NOW
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT YOUNG DOWN THAT BRAIN
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT PART LIZARD KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SOCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO TRY ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THE MORE THEY ARE
I WAS GROWING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I'LL SAY WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING MANY CORNERS BECAUSE THE WASHER ENJOYER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THESE PREDESTRUCTURES
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROVABLE SAMPLE
THEY CAN NAVIGATE SPATIAL
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBER
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WHY NOT JUST THAT BUSINESSES CAN BE
SO LIKE TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD MOLECULES IN PLANETS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING ALL TOO
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT AMAZED
THEY FEEL LIKE HOME
