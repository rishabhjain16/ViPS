WE REALLY DON'T WALK ANYMORE
AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO GET OUT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THIS AM I GOING TO BE REJECTED
WE'D LOVE TO HELP
I WASN'T VERY GOOD AT READING THINGS
AND HE SAID ON THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY YES
HE WAS SMILING AND WE SAID GO
WE SAID YES
WE WERE SO EXCITED
AND SO ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES OF OUR PROJECT REALLY IS TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WE'RE TAKEN BEFORE SOMETHING
NOT WHAT IS IT
PREDICTIONS ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE
THEY ARE THE BASIS OF EVERY ACTION THAT YOU TAKE
IT'S USING PAST EXPERIENCE BASED ON SIMILAR SITUATIONS TO TRY TO MAKE MEETING
AND SO HOW DOES YOUR BRAIN GIVE YOU THAT DETAIL
WELL THAT'S WHAT PREDICTIONS ARE
I'M TOTALLY SERIOUS
I KNOW I HAVE
SO WHEN YOU'RE BORN YOU CAN MAKE FEELINGS LIKE COMMNESS AND
I'M NOT A SOCIAL PROBLEM GUY
I FEEL GUILTY SOMETIMES
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT STAYING IN THE WORKFORCE IS THE RIGHT THINGS FOR EVERYONE
BOY IT MATTERS A LOT
SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOUR JOB NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING
HE'S A GREAT GUY YOU
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR HIM Y
BLOCKS HAVE NAMES
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER TERM AND LOOK THAT UP
I DO LIKE MAGIC
I DON'T HAVE AN OVERVIEW
MORE TRUST IS NOT AN INTELLIGENT AIM IN THIS LIFE
TRUST IS THE RESPONSE
WE CAN DO IT TWO PEOPLE TOGETHER TRYING TO IMPROVE TRUST
BECAUSE IT'S GIVEN BY OTHER PEOPLE
LET ME GIVE YOU A SIMPLE COMMERCIAL EXAMPLE
WE'RE GOING TO EAT THESE COWS
THEY WANT DOING SHIP THAT PEOPLE
IT'S NOT OPTIONAL IT'S
SO WE KNOW IT ACTUALLY
WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH
SHE HAD TO IMPERSONATE A MAN
MORTALITY IS NOT GOING DOWN IT'S GOING UP
AND NOT ENOUGH AS BEING DONE ABOUT THIS
IT TOLD US ABOUT HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY
WOMEN ARE WORTH IT
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS TO THESE GALLS
THEY'RE OFTEN NOT RECOGNIZED SENT HOME
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS
OR ONCE AGAIN WOMEN GET THE INTIGRAM AND NOBODY CAN TELL THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
AND WE'D LIKE TO THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE 35 YEARS
AND IN FACT IT'S PROBABLY WRONG
SO WE HAVE THESE FEAST AND FAMINE CYCLES
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION
EVERYBODY FOCUSES ON THE THINGS THAT KILL US AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS FOCUSING ON
AND THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THE MICROBES AFTER THE TRANSPLANTS
ACTUALLY STUDY HORMONES
WE CAN'T SEE IT MOST OF THE TIME
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES
I HAVE THREE SONS SO I SEE HOW THEY FIGHT
WE'RE NOT JUST PA OF THE SAME SPECIES WE
WE'RE PART OF THE SAME FAMILY
AND I WILL NAME NAMES BUT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING
WHY ARE WE EMBEDDED IN SOCIAL NETWORKS
I MEAN HOW DO THEY FORM
HOW DO THEY OPERATE
HOW FAR DO THEY REACH
AND THE DAUGHTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM CARING FOR HER MOTHER
GIVE ME INPUT
THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT
THAT'S THE STATUS QUO TODAY
GOD JUST SIX PEOPLE
JUST IT'S HARD
BUT IT WASN'T JUST INDIVIDUALS
WELL THERE'S A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY
IT SHOULDN'T BE NATIONALISTIC
THIS ECONOMY WON'T WORK AND THOMAS JEFFERSON SAYING THE PEOPLE WON'T TRUST THAT
BUT THAT SYSTEM IS TONS OF PROBLEMS
WEALTH IS RIPPED AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL IN
OR DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDISTRIBUTE
AND NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL
SO I'M IN THE MEDIA
THEY DON'T REPRESENT WHAT OUR VIEWS ARE
WE HAD THE BATTLE BETWEEN JEFFERSON AND HAMILTON
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
SO NO MORE MESSING DIES OF
BUILDINGS CAN BE LIKE PEOPLE
THEIR FACES BROADCAST THEIR EXPERIENCE
AND THEN AT 11 A CLUB THEY STOP TALKING ABOUT THESE LITTLE ISSUES
SO JUST LIKE WITH THE BIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
YOU CAN TRY IT
I'M A PROFESSOR AND WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT EDUCATION
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
OF COURSE THEY NEED
BUT THIS IS WHAT I HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUTRAGED PEOPLE
WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WE NEED
THIS IS COMPLETELY BIZARRE
THEY'RE LOOKING AND LOOKING AND FINDING LOVE
WE CAN OPEN UP CITY HALL
I'M NOT A MILITARY BROTTEN
THEY SIGNED IT BECAUSE THEY WANT SOMETHING TO BENGE
ONE WAS TO BE A SOLDIER THE
THE OTHER WAS TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER
ARE YOU LOSING YOUR MIND
SO LET'S WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
SO THAT WAS EASY
WE WEREN'T CONSIDERED THE REAL THING
AND THE WAY TO DO IT IS THROUGH THE BLOODSTREAM
I WANT TO BE IN A CENTER OF CAPTAINTIAL
DOES YOU FIND A GOAL
I COULD MAKE THAT DECISION
AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SOLVING IS WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS
THEY WON THE GAME
SO BEAR WITH ME
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
MAKE ME LIFE
HOW CAN SOMEBODY LIKE THAT MAKE YOU FEEL SMART
HE MADE ME FEEL SMART
YOU SAW HIM BACK
WE DON'T USE AUDIO WE DON'T USE VIDEO
HOW ARE YOU
THE VOICE REMINDED ME OF HOME
I DON'T WANT TO
A SITTING ARABIC
AFTER COLLEGE I DESPERATELY NEEDED TO FIND A PLACE TO CALL HOME
ONE PERCENT CAN GET TO DO THAT
THEY HAD HIT THE JACKPOT
LIFE IS GOOD
IT WASN'T LIKE THEM TO MISPRACTICE
I DO UNDERSTAND THE
DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY MUCH
I DON'T KNOW
THEY TAKE THEM AWAY IS INFINITE FACT FOUR GOOD DISEASES
WHAT ABOUT POLIO
LET'S HAVE THAT
AND HE SAID THAT BEFORE
WE DON'T TRUST THEM IN
IT HAS TO STOP IT
IT'S A DEBATE ABOUT WORDS ABOUT METAPHORS
BUT IN FACT THEY FOUND SOMETHING VERY SURPRISING
WE USED TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING ECONOMY WHICH WAS ABOUT BUILDING GOODS AND PRODUCTS AND NOW WE HAVE A SERVICE
BUT THAT REALLY ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE
YOU WOULD BE ISSUING ORDERS FROM ABOVE
THIS IS A REAL MYSTERY I
AND THE GREAT THING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE ANYONE ALONG WITH YOU
IT'S NATURAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE
ORIGINALLY THE SAMPLE WAS AGED 18 TO 94
HOW SAD ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU RIGHT NOW
WE TAKE LESS NOTICE A TRIGGER IT MATTERS
WELL I WAS SURPRISED
I DID NOT KNOW THIS
NOW IN ALL SERIOUSNESS MOVIES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT
STORYTELLING IS SO IMPORTANT
STORIES ARE AMAZING
BUT WHAT DOES
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
YOU DON'T DO MUCH SHARE IT IN
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TO CREATE THESE RARE DAMN CHANGES REQUIRES YOU A WHOLE OFF AT LEAST
ONE YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT TIME IT IS
I'D HAVE TO TAKE YOUR ART
I'M TALKING ABOUT TEACHERS
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING DIFFERENTLY
SO WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT HELPS ALL OUR TEACHERS BE AS GOOD AS THE BEST
THEY SUPPORTED ME ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT AT
SOMETHING WAS WRONG
IS IT GOT BETTER
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAD TO CELEBRATE
YOUR RECONCILE LITTLE DIFFERENCES RIGHT
WE'RE LAST WITH PEOPLE WILL LISTEN TO US
IT WASN'T WHO I WAS
HERE'S WHERE I STAND
I TRIED EVERYTHING
WHAT A CONTRADICTION
OTHERWISE MILLIONS MORE WILL DIE
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A REAL JOB TITLE TO BE HONEST
IT WAS THE COLDEST I'VE EVER BEEN
1800 UNDER TO 6 PEOPLE DIED
HE GOT PART TIME I
I FORGIVE YOU AND I DO NOT HATE YOU
BECAUSE EACH YEAR THE WINNER HAS COME FROM A DIFFERENT TRIBAL GROUP
IF THE WATER STAY THERE FOREVER
WE DON'T NEED MOORE'S LAW TO CONTINUE
WE JUST NEED TO KEEP GOING
WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO SOLVE
I THINK WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE A MANHATTAN PROJECT ON THE TOPIC OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
IT CRACKED OPEN MY WORLD
SO THEY WON'T GO FOR A LOCK THEY WON'T HANG OUT WITH THEIR FRIENDS THEY WON'T BEAT
SHE WOULD HIDE IN THE CLOSETGE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW OFTEN THE DOG GETS OUTSIDE
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOUR DOG IS GETTING
HIS NAME IS LAUNNY HAT AND HE IS A VETERAN OF VIETNAM
FOR HEPATITIS IT WAS ALSO TWO AND A HALF TIMES
FOR DEPRESSION IT WAS FOUR AND A HALF TIMES
WHAT KIND OF TRAUMA AM I TALKING ABOUT HERE
CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS REPEATING OF STRESS ACTIVATION
WELL IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING IN THE FOREST AND YOU SEE A BEAR
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH
IT'S THE WAR ON TERROR YOU
YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT OUT
ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
PLUS WE HAVE STEM CELLS
I WAS ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS I
I KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TEN PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS SURGERY
AND WHEN I WAS 10 I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW AMAZING IT WAS
THEY WOULD KNOW BACKDOORS
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THIS FISHING VILLAGE WAS FAMOUS FOR SCULPTURE
I DON'T PAINT
IT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY FREAKING OBVIOUS
DAN REPLIES SO OFTEN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AND THEN SOMETHING FALLS OFF THE WALL
WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THAT WASN'T THE CASE FOR ME
NO MORE CHARGED BEFORE USE
AND THAT'S BAD
WHAT ABOUT MANIPULATION
SO THAT'S MODEL OF NEGULATION
I LOVE BUILDING ROBOTS
AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IT IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE HORMONE QUESTION IS A REALLY COMPLEX
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THEY COULD TAP INTO A WORKFORCE
I TACKED ALONG WITH MY NEIGHBORS
AND I SAID TO MYSELF I WANT TO GET ME ONE OF THEM
HE WROTE THAT
I'LL MEET YOU THERE
THE KEY HERE REALLY IS KNOWLEDGE
I TRIED EVERYTHING
MAYBE I DID AN EXPERIMENT ON MYSELF WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT
YOU JUST HAD A NEW THING SOMETIMES
AND BOY THEY WERE LIKE ONE
HOW DO YOU GET TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS
SO WE CREATED A NEW SCHOOL
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
IT'S ALMOST BECOMING THE SYNTAX OF A NEW LANGUAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND STATISTICS THAT'S A SUBJECT THAT YOU COULD AND SHOULD USE
THIS IS WHAT I'M JUST TO NATURALLY BE ABLE TO DO
WHY IT DID NOT WORKING
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE RIGHT
IT BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND IT SUPPORTS CREATIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION
DID YOU THE APPIA IS ONE IN MY HEAD
I MEAN EVERYONE DID
AGAIN IT WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
IT MEANS TOO HAPPY
I HAVE RESOURCES
AND IS THIS REALLY THE SOLUTION
SO I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
IN OTHER WORDS A CORNER COULD FIND THESE THINGS BECAUSE THIS IS A FATAL REST OF IT
AND REMEMBER WE HAD EXPERIENCED WITH THIS
ROUGHLY 300 SAVINGS AND LOANS INVOLVED ROUGHLY 600 SENIOR PHYSICS
THAT IS NOT SIMPLY CRITICAL TO OUR ECONOMY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO
WHAT CAN WE DO IN ALL OF THIS
I'M 27 YEARS OLD
THAT'S MORE EXPENSIVE AND
WHEN WE DO THE RESULTS WILL OFTEN SURPRISE
I WANT TO STAND THIS RELATIONSHIP
THINGS WERE GOING WELL
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CHAPTER TO ME
WHY ARE WE SKIPPING OVER THIS
I WENT TO THE DEAN
BUT HERE'S THE THING
IT'S NOT LIKE TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BIKE
I DON'T KNOW
AND THAT LED ME TO THIS PROJECT
YOU'VE HAVE TO TURN THAT AROUND
SO WHEN THE CHURCH AS OFTEN AS I'M COOL
IT'S A PERFORMANCE VAN YOU
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH
AND THEY'RE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON MONEY
I HAVE BUILT A CAREER
WE ARE IMAGINED
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FLAT AND THEY'RE BASICALLY CARDBOARD CHARACTERS
I GOT ABOUT 3000 E MAILS
WHERE ARE YOUR WEBSITES
IT'S ALWAYS WHAT IT WAS AND WHAT IT CAN BE
THEY'RE NOT MY CHILDREN
AND WHEN WE'RE UNPREPARED WE OVERREACT
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
WE CAN BUILD HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS AROUND RACE IF WE LEARN TO CALCULATE LOCATE
AND LOOKING AT THAT PATTERN
HE SAW IT WRITTEN DOWN SOME WAY
AND NOW WE WANT TO DO A DOUBLE DOUBLE OF THE AGE WAY OF COMING THROUGH
THAT'S SORT OF THE STATE OF THE ART
WHAT'S THIS GUY TALKING ABOUT
LET ME INDUSTRATE THIS
AND HE'S A BAD GUY
THERE WERE OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE A WHOLE TIME
IT'S NOT A DIRTY WORD
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED ON THE SPOT AT
WELL YOU GET SEVERAL THINGS
HE GUESSED THAT THEY USED AT FIRST IN MANY CASES WAS OXYGEN
SO THEY ADDED OXYGEN TO METHANE GAS
SO WHAT IS AN IDEA GROWING
HERE I'M ONE PERSON TALKING TO YOU
WE WERE ALL COLLECTIVE
AND IF IT'S PEOPLE IN THE O TELL YOU WHAT'S THE JOKE
THEY CHANGED FROM PERSON TO PERSON
WE'VE ALL DONE THIS
WHEN IT'S 10 DEGREES BLOW ZERO
THERE'S LOVE AND THERE'S FRIENDSHIP AND THERE'S PROTECTION
YOU DESTROY ALL THE BONE MARROW IN THE CANCER PATIENT WITH MASSIVE DOSES OF CHEMOTHERAPY
WE SEE IT AS A DISRUPTION OF REAL LIFE AND IMPORTANT WORK
SHE SUFFERED SO MUCH
COULD WE MERGE
THAT'S AWFUL RIGHT
SORT OF LEADERSHIP LIKE HUMILIATION
THANKS FOR ASKING
AND I SAID WHERE IS HE NOW
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK
WE CHANGE THE ECONOMICS FOR THE BAD GODS
HE HAD THE RIGHT TO US THAT
I'M A FEMINIST BUT I'M A RATHER BAD ONE
I AM FULL OF CONTRADICTIONS
I WANT NO PART OF ANY OF THAT
I ENJOY FASHION MAGAZINES AND PRETTY THINGS
WE GO FAR BEYOND REASONABLE CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM TO DISSECTING ANY GIVEN WOMAN'S FEMINISM
THEY ARE GORGEOUS AND HEADSTRONG BRILLIANT GIRLS WHO ARE A WHOLE LOT OF BRAVE
SOME BOYS BROKEN WHEN I WAS SO DOWN I DID NOT KNOW WHAT POSED CAN DO TO BREAK A BROAD
I LEARNED TO WRITE LIKE THEM AND THEN I LEARNED TO WRITE AS MYSELF
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE A LITTLE BIT BRAVE WHEN WE MOST NEED SUCH BRAVE WE CAN
WE'RE SEEING THE BABY BRAIN
LOTS OF MONEY
SUPPORTING LOCAL AUTOMATES
IT'S A TOP PREDATIVE
I'M NOT READY
BUT I'M GOING TO BE SO HEALTHY
I WANT TO KNOW HOW I IMPACT THEM I
I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY IMPACT ME
SO LET'S START THERE
I MADE MORE MONEY
IT'S STRAIGHT
WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF OUR GROUP PLANT ON A WORLD PANT
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE TO THE STORY THAN THAT
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW THE MOLECULES ARE PUT TOGETHER
THE OIL WILL NEVER RUN OUT
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HIGH TECH EXPERIENCE OF PREGNANCY OTHERWISE SOMETHING MIGHT GO WRONG
THEY WANT INTRIGUED
WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE
MY FATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY HE SAID
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED AT THIS FACTORY
IF YOU MIGHT ASK ALL OF THE STATES TO DO THAT INSTEAD
AND IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS SOMETHING TO OFFER
I'VE TRIED ENGAGING PEOPLE
AND KEYS SURPRISED ME BY SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT
PATRIARCHY IS NOT BOYS IN MEN
THAT ALLOWED ME TO TAKE A STAND FOR MYSELF
I STARTED TO WRITE ABOUT SHARING THE FACT THAT I'M A SURVIVOR OF ALL FORMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE IMPLETING THROUGH THE
AND GUESS WHAT SILICON VALLEY
SO I'M GOING TO SAY AWESOME STUFF ABOUT MYSELF
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW
IT CAME FROM THE WAY IN WHICH BEIJING HAS GROWN AS A CITY
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
AND WE COULDN'T JUST TURN IT OFF
YOU'RE IN THERE
BUT THE SECOND OF THE TRANSPORTATIONS THE CLIMATE TRANSPORTATIONS WE HAVE TO DESIGN IT TO DO
WE CAN SEE HOW TO DO THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE ON IT'S NOT LIKE WE DON'T HAVE COME
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TEACH YOU SOMETIMES WORK
AND IN THAT I NEED A CIRCULAR ACCIDENT
MY RESEARCH TEAM AND I WENT TO WESTPOINT MILITARY ACADEMY
THAT'S THE WORK THAT STANDS BEFORE US
WE'RE GOING TO START PUTTING AN ENTIRE LAYER VIRTUAL INFORMATION ON THE REAL WORLD
WE'RE ON THE GRID
COULDN'T GO WHAT IN SCIENCE DOING AND WHY
I EXIST BECAUSE I HAVE MY OWN FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
AND GUESS WHAT
I LOOKED AT SLAVES
THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY THE MARKET
IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL
THIS IS THE ONLY PART THAT'S BATTERY BACKED U
IN GERMANY AND FRIENDS
4 TIMES WHEN I SAID FOR SOME
SURELY WE KNOW ENOUGH WE
THE SAME TOOL THAT UNITED US TO TOPPLE DICTATORS
I WAS TERRIFIED
WHAT IS WORTH DYING FOR
THAT IS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE
WE CAN CHANGE OUR MINDS
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT
WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE IT FASTER
WE WILL NOT BE THERE
WHAT IS THAT
SHE CONTACTED ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WAS WILLING TO BUY MY WORK
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A ROCKET SCIENCE
IT'S CHANGED THE WAY WE TALK
I'VE GOT ABOUT
HAD NO IDEA
THEY DON'T TRUST IT ALL
WHY DON'T THEY CHESS ALONG
WAS NOT FULLY
THAT WAS ONLY WENT TO BE ANYTHING DONE
THAT'S A GOAL RIGHT NOW
ART IS NOT EFFICIENT
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT EFFICIENT
EFFICIENCY IS FOUR ROBOTS
CHINA IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST ANTI POVERTY PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES
HOW ELSE CAN WE CREATE NEW IDEAS
BUT SOME OF OUR GRANDCHILDREN PROBABLY WILL
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED AT MY DAD
MY DAD HAS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THEY GET SCARED TO WALK AROUND
LET ME SCARE THE MORE
I'M TRYING TO BECOME A BETTER PER
EVEN WHEN IT'S SO HARD
AND WHAT I NEED NOW IS TO LEARN TO BE LIKE THAT
SO THIS IS AN OBVIOUS RIGHT
SO WHAT'S WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES MENTORING
IS IT THE TIME RIGHT THAN A GIRL
QUITE THE OPPOSITE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS A MUCH MORE COMPLETE RECIPE FOR DEEP
THIS MEANT THAT THE MOVEMENTS DEMANDING CHANGE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE AGAINST CRUSHING POVERTY WIDENING
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS ARE GROWING AND RESISTING WITH TREMENDOUS COURAGE
WELL VERY OFTEN WE THINK ABOUT POLITICAL CHANGE IN DEFINE COMPARTMENTS THESE DAYS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND MOST OF ALL WHAT ITS CORE VALUES ARE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO A GROUP OF US IN CANADA DECIDED THAT WE WERE HITTING THE LIMITS OF WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH
SO WE'VE LOCKED OURSELVES IN A ROOM FOR TWO DAYS AND WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BOUND US TOGETHER
WELL WE REJECTED ALL OF THAT
BUT IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO TRAIN OUR BRAINS TO TUNE OUT WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE'S ISSUE
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
I DON'T KNOW
THE SCIENCE IS THAT
LET'S THINK ABOUT YOUR ETHICAL FOLKPRINT
BUT QUITE FRANKLY ON THIS ISSUE THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD
AND HE WANTED ONE SO BADLY
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY SECOND POINT
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE SUGGESTION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO AIM FOR THAT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY UNLEASHING OF NEW POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION FOR DEVELOPMENT
THERE WOULD BE INVISIBLE CAPACITY
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL HAVE IT
OF COURSE MIGRATION BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
AND THIS CHANGE IS GETTING MORE RAPID
I DIDN'T KNOW IF SUCCEED
I HADN'T BAID IN THREE DAYS
WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE
AND I CRIED
I WAS WEDDING AWARDS
I WAS LIVING IN MY OWN APARTMENT
I WAS NO LONGER HOMELESS
RACE IS A SOCIAL CATEGORY THAT HAS STAGGERING BIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
I'M ALSO ON THIS MISSION BECAUSE THE WAY DOCTORS PRACTICE MEDICINE CONTINUES TO
I KNOW PLATFORMS ABOUT IT COMPUTERS THEY PUT ME ON THE INTERNET WHEN I WAS YOUNG
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT HOW WE LIVE
WHAT WOULD THAT CHANGE ABOUT QUALITY OF LIFE IN NUTRITION
A DIGITAL WORLD FARM
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT
WELL THAT'S EXCITING
AND DANCE HAS PROGRESSED
THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY
THEY'RE NOT DONATED
THEY'RE NOT HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
AND USE IS WHAT CREATES IMPACT
HOW COULD I COME FROM THE NATION
WHAT KIND OF RITUALS ARE USED
THE RITUALS WERE FAMILIAR
WHY DO I BELIEVE THIS
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE DID
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT DATA
AND SO KNOWING THAT WE WENT TO THE ADVERTISING COUNCIL AND WE ASKED THEM TO HELP US
WE WERE MAKING WHAT WAS INVISIBLE VISIBLE
TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF OUR SPOTS
AND LET ME JUST PUT THIS IN CONTEXT
WE WERE OBVIOUSLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE
BUT WE WERE STILL MISSING A CRITICAL ELEMENT
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE MET MEN WHERE THEY WERE AT AND WE BUILT A PROGRAM
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COACHING BOYS AND TO MEN AND CHANGING THE CULTURE OF THE LOCKER ROOM AND GIVING THEM
TEXTING HAS A 100 PERCENT OPEN RATE
I THINK IT MIGHT BE A LIFELINE
HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ME ONE
IT'S MY DAD
THAT LAST ONE'S AN ACTUAL TEXT MESSAGE THAT WE RECEIVED
I WILL NOT FORGET THE DAY WE GOT THAT TEXT MESSAGE
AND SO IT WAS THAT DAY THAT WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO BUILD A CRISIS TEXT HOTLINE
THE NAZIS INFRADED THE NETHERLANDSHIP
BUT WHEN I WAS LITTLE I REMEMBER HE WOULD KILL FLIES IN HER HOUSE WITH MY VIVI GUNS
IT WAS LIKE A STAR TECHNICITY YOU KNOW
I STARTED OPEN NEW GANDA
ON THAT'S WITH US
I'M IN TUCSON
WE HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN
AND I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO ANY SAYING
SO I LOOKED FOR FURNITURE
WHY THE GREAT PASSION IS THE ENVIRONMENT
I WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL
SO LET'S GET STARTED NOW
GO I SET AGAIN SWEAT FORMING ON MY BROWN
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO IF IT DIDN'T WORK
SCIENCE FICTION IS ONE OF THE GREATEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE FORMS OF POLITICAL WRITING
IT WAS FAULTY AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAD TO RESTART IT OVER AND OVER BEFORE IT WORKED
FOR AFRICANS HOMEGROWN SCIENCE FICTION CAN BE A WILL TO POWER
IT IS IN THE WATER
MY MOTHER WAS ON THE LINE TO TELL ME THAT DOCTORS HAD FOUND A LUMP IN HISTOMACH TERMINAL CANCER
WE SUSPENDED OUR VALUES
AND WHAT WAS THE RESULT OF THAT
BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHINA
WHERE THE PHILOSOPHERS
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO PLEASURE SPEAKING TO YO
LAST WEEK ALONE I GOT 238 PIECES OF NASTY EMAIL AND MORE
BUT I'M A BIG FAN OF YOU AS A PERSON
AND SO THEY TOOK THEM TO SOME SAFE PLACE
AND THAT WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO MY BRAIN
I UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAVE BEEN
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AND THAT LEADS TO A VERY POWERFUL TOOL
TO MEET MORE THAT CLEAN
THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE CASE
IMAGINE IF WE HAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW LOCAL PLACES BUT
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF YOU
IT'S JUST A WALL
I HAVE PASSION IN MY HEART
I CAN STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING
BOTH OF THEM BRING THE IMAGINATION TO LIFE IN WAYS THAT REMIND US THAT ALL OF OUR BONDS IN THE END
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
AND THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING
THAT OPTION IS ACTUALLY NOT ON THE TABLE
SO IT'S OUT TO US
WE COULD ONLY THINK OF ONE WAY
I EVEN READ MANY SELF HELP BOOKS
THE FIRST LESSON IS ABOUT THE WORLD
TRY AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT WORKS WE DO IT
I WILL LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU
WHO'S UP THE EVENT
WHATEVER IT WAS ABOUT THAT PERSON WHERE THEY WOULD BOTH THINGS LIKE THAT
I CAN USE IT IN MY COMPANY
IT'S RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO FIND
THERE'S NOTHING UNDERGROUND ABOUT IT
WE ONLY SELL YOU AIRTIME
IT WAS A PALM
PAIN RUNS THROUGH MY BODY WITH THE FIRES OF MY LOVE FOR HUMAN
I REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
I AM THINKING OF YOUR LOVE FOR ME
I AM TORNED BY A LOVE FEMININE
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID MY LOVE
AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW
WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT HOW IS IT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
WE LEARNED MORE ABOUT HOW COMPUTERS WERE
HE WANTED TO KEEP SCORE
IT IS USEFUL FOR EVERYBODY TO LEARN HOW TO READ AND WRITE A
YOU BOARD THE PLANE
THE PLANE TAKES OFF
THE ENGINE TRAILS
NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
THIS IS NOT A STATEMENT ON MALNUTRITION OR ANYTHING ELSE
THE NET OUTCOME
CHINA IS CONSTRAINED IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE LAND IT ACTUALLY HAS AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE AND IT HAS MASSIVE
THAT EVEN SMALL SCALE FARMERS CAN LEVERAGE
WE JUST NEED TO ACT ON IT
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CREATE A SECOND ONE TOGETHER
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VENUES IN WHICH THOSE PUBLIC SPACES WHERE WE COME TOGETHER
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THE ANSWER
OR ANY NATIONAL LEADER
THE SUPREME COURT HAS FOLLOWED WAY DOWN FROM WHAT IT USED TO BE
THEY WERE ARGUING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT ACCESS TO THE POLICE ITS
WE ARE DOING IT TOGETHER
THAT IS THE REAL WORLD AND UNLESS WE FIND A WAY TO GLOBALIZE DEMOCRACY OR
WE CAN CREATE A GLOBAL PARLIAMENT OF MAYORS
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL FACTS ARE
BUT NOW IT'S TURNED AROUND
THEN THEY HAVE TO BRING THEM IN
MAKE IT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTY
WELL I THINK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME
THEY ALL LIVED THE SAME LIBERAL MICROSCOPE I MEAN TO A FIRST APPROXIMATION
BUT NOW CHECK OUT WHERE THEY GO ON OUR TREE OF LIFE
IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE
HOW CLOSE THAT
NOW HAMILTON WAS EVERYTHING MEDICINE WAS NOT
AND THEY DID IT IN A GOOD OLD FASHIONED WAY
FIRST THEY FOUNDED POLITICAL PARTIES
WELL WE BOUGHT ONE OF THESE
IT'S KIND OF THE ANTI REALITY TV
NOBODY COMES TO GET FAMOUS
AND IT'S HARD AND IT TAKES COURAGE BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALIVE RIGHT
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT
I AM FASCINATED BY THOSE TIMES WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT SEE BY THE EYE
HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS THE BLUE SHINE
BONE THIS IS NOT THE SLOGAN FROM AN INSPIRATIONAL POSTER
I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM
ETHIS REALS IN BOSTON
THAT'S A TERRIBLE WASTE OF TIME
DO THAT ONLY IF YOU'RE PAID BY THE HOUR
SO THE VERY FIRST THING WE WANTED TO DO IN THIS BUILDING WAS LOOK AT THE AIR SYSTEM
THAT'S MY QUESTION
I WAS NOT GOING TO CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP
I WOULD JUST GIVE THE INSPIRATION AND THAT'S MY JOB I
THROUGH OUR NEW EXTERNAL CAMERAS
IN FACT IT'S MORE LIKE FIVE PERCENT
AND WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT
IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT MY CARRY YOUNG BAG FROM THE GROUND TO THE CAROSELL
IT'S NOT ONE WAY
AND I THOUGHT WHAT MY THINKING
WAS FIVE YEARS OLD
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS
THEY HAVE DIVERGENT VALUES
IT MEANS FOR YOUTH AND IT'S A NEW ARAB TV CHANNEL
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT FIRE AND BRACEDONE EITHER
THERE'S AN ANIMATED SERIES IN THE WORKS
IN SHE'S LOOKING AS YOUNG AS EVER
I SAT THERE ON THE RIVER FOR TWO MONTHS WITHOUT SEEING ONE
WHICH MEANS TAKE MY CAMERA
AND HE THINKS I'M SAYING TAKE MY PICTURE
I WENT TO EXTREME LINKS TO TRY TO BE STRAIGHT
AND THE SOLDIER ON THE FRONT TANK SAID WE HAVE UNCONDITIONAL ORDER TO DESTROY THIS
BUT IF YOU WON'T MOVE WE'LL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN YOU DOWN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM
WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING ON WIKIPEDIA
IT'S A COMPOSITE VIEW THAT'S CONSTANTLY CHANGING BEING UPDATED
WE CAN CREATE A DECENTRALIZED DATABASE THAT HAS THE SAME EFFICIENCY OF MONOPOLY
BECAUSE WE CAN
SO WHEN WE MET CHUCK WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL
NOT A SINGLE ONE
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW IS HOW MUCH CAN WE MAKE OF IT
HOW MUCH CAN WE CHANGE
WHO IS ALSO THE FIRST MESSAGE OF COMMON FOREST
MY BROTHERS ARE NOT AS INTERESTED AS I AM
IT'S BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE
THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY ALSO MONITORED THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF
TERRORISTS ARE DOING THIS
WHEN IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY HAS IT EVER BEEN POSSIBLE FOR ONE PERSON TO ROB
OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO GO EVEN DEEPER THAN THE HUMAN BODY
WE'RE GOING DOWN TO THE CELLULAR LEVEL OF THESE DAYS
WE CAN DO THIS
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE BEST THAT I'VE LOOKED AT SOMEONE WORKS
I'M SO SAR
ONE YEAR I CAME UP WITH A BRIGHT IDEA
WE KNOW WHY KIDS DON'T LEARN
YOU MADE IT WORK FOR ME
AND HE PUT ON THE OFFER ALL MY PHONE
WHAT IS THE ABSTRACTION
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T QUESTION THAT
THAT'S WHAT LEADS YOU
I'M IN THE PRINCIPLE RIGHT NOW
I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
75 PERCENT OF THEM ALGORITHM AND CHILDREN
THAT WAS HER FIGHT
SHE GOT AS SHE CAUGHT NETFORMS
YOU LEARNED ABOUT YOUR BRIBES YOU
HE WAS DOING NOTHING
WHAT IS THE EXACT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LETTERS OF GREENHOUSE GASES AND PLANETARY
WHY DO WE NEED TO STUDY THIS ANYMORE
THAT WE ALREADY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF A CHANGING CLIMATE ON OUR SEVEN CIVILIZATION
INDEED WE RUN THE RISK OF MAKING THINGS WORSE
IMAGINE JUDGLING THE SCHOOL WALL ACROSS THE TOPICS
AND NOT JUST THAT
THEY MET TOGETHER
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT NOW
SO WHAT DID THEY DO
BUT PEOPLE DID NOT RELATE TO THIS
I DON'T KNOW
PEOPLE STARTED CONTRIBUTING IDEAS
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED
YOU SEE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE DATA ON
IT'S A COMING OF AGE FOR BRINGING DATA INTO THE HUMANITARIAN WORLD
BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET
AND THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRIGGER EIGHT FUNDING BEFORE A CRISIS WILL HAPPEN
DATA DRIVES BETTER DECISIONS
IT'S A WIN ALL AROUND
AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR A PROFESSION THAT'S IN HIGH DEMAND
THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW SYSTEM BASED ON DONATED PACKAGE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY AND THE LOGISTICS COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER SINCE WILL SINCE WE WERE KIDS REALLY
WITH BROUGHT UP TO THIS
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP
SO WHAT TO DO NEXT
THE SECOND IS YOU CAN PUT LOTS AND LOTS WITH CHEST IN A VERY SMALL BUT
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
DO THEY HAVE AGED
WE HAVE COMMON COLD
YOU MAKE IT FLOW UNDER AND OVER
AND SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT KIND OF ARTISTIC POTENTIAL DESERVES SO MUCH MORE
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
IT TOOK SIX DAYS TO DEPLOY A GLOBAL MALWARE CAMPAIGN
IT SHOULD BE INSPIRING
SOME DID NOT EVERYBODY
EVEN THAT WASN'T ENOUGH
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE POLICY AT THE GOVERNMENT OF HER
I SHOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I DIDN'T TALK TO THEM
GO PICK AT THE KEYS
THEY'RE TOO BUSY PUTTING OUT DAILY FIRES TO THINK AHEAD STRATEGICALLY
AND THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK FOR PERMISSION
AND I SAID THAT'S A GOOD JOB
RIGHT THIS ISN'T INFORMATION THE
IT'S SUPER REAL AND IT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THAT'S WHAT'S SO PROPAGANDA ABOUT WAR
IT WAS INCREDIBLY HOT
HOW DOES THAT WORK
IT'S NOT WHAT I HAD EXPECTED
WHAT IS IT THAT HE MISSES
WE HAVE TO ANSWER THAT
IT WAS IT UP THERE FOR A YEAR
SOME OF THEM GOT OUT OF THE ARMY AND HAD TREMENDOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS WHEN THEY GOT HOME
THAT MEANS AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR PROBLEM TOO
I REALIZED OF COURSE THAT ALL COUNTRIES ARE UNIQUE
BUT THAT'S NOTHING SPECIAL
IT HAD NO CHOICE
AGAIN THEY HAD NO CHOICE
JUT WHEN THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO
I IMAGINE THAT MY KIDS ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES ARE FRESH WATER
HOW MUCH THEY DO FOR
AND WE'VE CONNECTED OVER REALLY SMALL THINGS LIKE THE FACT THAT I LOVE COUNTRY MUSIC WHICH IS REALLY
THIS IS NOT A PHOTO PROFILE FOR YOUR FACEBOOK
THAT DIDN'T GO REALLY WELL
SO TO SUMMARIZE IF WE CAN OFFER A TOP QUALITY EDUCATION TO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD FOR FREE
THE ANSWER WAS NO
TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
AND I GOT PRETTY INTO IT
THIS IS HOW STUFF IS MADE MEMORABLE
WHAT MAKES TECHNOLOGY USEFUL AND USABLE
I WOULD PASS MY OWN DRUM
I WILL NOT BE PLAYED
WE WERE MORE WOMEN COMPLICATED
I LIVE CYCLES OF LIGHT AND DARKNESS
RHYTHM IS HALF SILENCE
I SEE NOW I NEVER WAS ONE AND NOT THE OTHER
SICKNESS HEALTH TENDER VIOLENCE
ONE WOMAN LOSES HER HEAD
RUNWALLING FEEDS ON TRASH
ONE WOMAN SHOOTS HER FACE
ONE WOMAN STRAPS HERSELF
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO A BABY
ONE WOMAN GIVES BIRTH TO BORDERS
ONE WOMAN NO LONGER BELIEVES LOVE WILL EVER FIND HER
ONE WOMAN NEVER DID
WHERE DO REFUGEE HEARTS GO
FACED WITH ABSENCE
MY SPINE CURVES SPIRAL
PLUS THE BOMBS LEFT BEHIND
HARVEST CONTAMINATED TOBACCO
SO AFTER 25 YEARS AND I BEGAN TO HEAL AS THOUGH I WAS RUNNING DRY
YOU HAVE A SELLING ME FOREVER I
OF THOSE SEVEN HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
I AM PUSHING AND PULLING WITH THIS OBJECT
SHE GOT UNLUCKY
WHAT IF OBESITY ISN'T THE CAUSE OF INSULIN RESISTANCE AT ALL
THAT WASN'T WHEN WE ASKED
ONLY ONE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FARMERS
SO WHAT CAN WE DO
TALK TO FARMERS
CASUAL SPEECH IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
THAT'S WHAT TEXTING IS
IT'S A MARKER OF EMPATHY
ANY SPOKEN LANGUAGE IS USED BY REAL PEOPLE HAS THEM
TEXTING HAS DEVELOPED ONE FROM THIS SLASH
WHY DID I REALLY HAVE TO MOTE ALONG
YOU CAN'T RUN AROUND IN THE DARK
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND ANYTHING THE OTHER THAN YOUR OWN TEETH
IT IS NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT ME THINK CRITICAL
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED IT
YOU HAVE TO GET A QUIET
HOW CAN WE DO IT
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DISGUISED AS LOVE ONE
WHICH IS WHY THAT I BELIEVE DEGREE IN THE WALL STREET JOB IN HIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE
AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
SHOW OF YOU AS THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL
AND I WENT BACK HOME AND I SAID DADDY I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
SO SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN THE BRIDGE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE CLOCKED OVER ME
BROUGHT HIM YOUNGER MEN
IT'S ABOUT PROVING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CAN DO
AND THIS IS TRUE
AND THEY TRACK IT
I LIVE IN WHICH YOU'RE MADE
WHEN YOU'RE SIX MAYBE YOU CAN DO THAT
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
HOW OLD ARE YOU
SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOLD WITH 2000 BASIS
SO MOMENTUM IS GOOD
OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS YOUR PLANNING SO HARD FOR LIKE HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
HOW DO I GET THROUGH THE HARDEST PART
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
AND TO DO SO WE'VE HAD TO BELIEVE IN IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
YOU WERE BORN TO
THAT'S WHAT WE DO
YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID
WE HEAR THE CHAOS OF WAR
WE HEAR TERRORISM
THEIR SILENT MAJORITY DOES NOT NEED TO BE SILENT
LET'S HELP THEM HAVE A VOICE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
AND WE ALL KNOW THIS
OK THEN WE CAN MAKE A MOBILE BAGGARE COUNTER
AND YOU DRIVE AROUND
YOU CAN GET VOLUNTEERS
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
AND THEN WE WERE ALARMED TO DISCOVER SOMETHING
NO COUNTER IS NO FISH
AS AN INVENTOR I TRY AND TURN FANTASY INTO REALITY
NOT WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER
IT'S AN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESS
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS
BUT ONE WAY AROUND THIS IS TO DRAW PICTURES
AND THIS IDEA IS ACTUALLY NOTHING NEWS
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
I MEAN I THOUGHT POETRY WAS JUST SELF EXPRESSION
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE CREATIVE CONTROL
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S A FORMER SHELTER
5 PERCENT TODAY
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM HAVING AN EFFECTIVE AD CAN BE
WHERE WOULD IT GO
YOU CAN WALK AROUND THEM
WAS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY A PLACE THAT YOU COULD VISIT
COULD I GO THERE
WHO WOULD I MEET
THE WHOLE INTERNET
IS IT HEAVY
I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS THING THAT ONLY FOOLS SEEMED TO LOOK FOR
YOU CAN EXPERIENCE THEIR SENSE OF PLACE
WE LET OTHER PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT IT
SO I LEARNED NEVER TO MOVE
IT WOULD SKIP A BEAT
IT WOULD START
IT WOULD STOP
AND I FELT ON THIS
DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER
WHY IS THAT HARD
THAT WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING WHEN WE SEE THAT
AND SO MANY OF MY EARLY MEMORIES INVOLVED INTRICATE DAYDREAMS WHERE I WOULD WALK ACROSS BORDERS
THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS A VERY DEFINITIVE
AND HE SAID WELL I JUST CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT MY CUSTOMERS THAT I WOULD NEVER SELL THEM ONE OF OUR CRAFTY PRODUCTS
IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME
AGREEABLE OF PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY THEY'RE NICE THEY'RE POLITE
WHEREAS GIVING AND TAKING OUR MORE OF YOUR INNER MOTIVES WHAT ARE YOUR VALUES
AND YOUR ATTENTION TOWARD OTHERS
THIS ANSWER ROUNDED BY LUNCH OF SLAKES AND SHARKS
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I FIND SO INTRIGUING ABOUT THE REACTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO THE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT INTERACTION DESIGN
AND DOES IT MATTER
YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE ONCE AGAIN THERE'S THE SCHOOL PROBLEM OF DESIGN BEING OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD FOR ART
DESIGNERS ARE SPIRED TO BE REALLY GREAT DESIGNERS
WHAT WE WANT WILL BE INSPIRED TO WHAT WE
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OF COURSE
WE'RE GOING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER
IN THAT INTERFACE IS BEAUTIFUL
IT TURNED OUT THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT OF LOW LEVEL DRUG CASES ON THE STREETS JUST AROUND THE CORNER FROM OUR OFFICE AND TRENTED
NOW AT THAT TIME CANDON NEW JERSEY WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS CITY IN AMERICA
I RAN THE CANDON POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THAT
AND THEY WOULD TAKE A BELONG STICKY AND GOING QUITE SOMETHING LIE AND THEY'D PUT IT ALL OF THEM
AND ONE OF THEM SAID WE HAD A ROBBERY TWO WEEKS AGO
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
WE HAVE NO SUSPECTS
IT WORKED FOR THE OPEN AIDS AND IT WORKED IN THE STATE OF THE JERSEY
WE TOOK CANVON OFF THE TOP OF THE LIST OF THE MOON DANGER CITY IN AMERICA
AND ALL OF THIS MATTERS GREATLY BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY TO ME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF
THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME
THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEIR DAY IN COURT
AND 67 PERCENT OF PEOPLE COME BACK
SO WHEN I STARTED MY JOB AT THE ARNOLD FOUNDATION I CAME BACK TO LOOKING AT A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND I CAME BACK
AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY I FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY THAT I DID ABOUT THE STATE OF
SO I DECIDED TO FOCUS ON USING DATA AND ANALYTICS TO HELP MAKE THE MOST CRITICAL DECISION
IT IMPACTS EVERYTHING
IT IMPACTS SENTENCING
IT IMPACTS CRIME AND VIOLENCE
AND WHEN I TALK TO JUDGES AROUND THE UNITED STATES WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME NOW THEY ALL SAY IN THE SAME
BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHICH BY THE WAY THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT THE DATA
AND I COULDN'T GET THIS INFORMATION OUT
AND AT THE OFF OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM WE'RE DOING AN EQUALLY TERRIBLE JOB
THEY'RE LIKE THE BASEBALL SCOUTS 20 YEARS AGO
SOME PEOPLE CALL IT DATA SCIENCE
THEY WERE UNBELIEVABLY EXPENSIVE TO ADMINISTER THEY WERE TIME CONSUMING THEY WERE LIMITED TO THE LOCAL
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED
BUT JUST IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT WHAT THIS MUST BE LIKE
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS
WE DO TRAIN THEM HOWEVER TO ADJUST AUTION ACCORDING TO WHERE THEY ARE
OUT TO DINNER WITH FAMILY
YOU REMEMBER CARLOS
WE WANTED TO SIT WHEN HE COULD SCAN THE LANE WHEN HE COULD GET A PLAN ESCAPE ROUTEFUL IT COULD GET HIS HAND
HOW DO YOU CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR
HE COULD COME OVER AND HELP ME
AND IT DOESN'T
SO NATURALLY I ASKED WHAT IS AFRICAN
I DON'T LOOK DIFFERENT
I'M NOT SHORT
AGAIN LET'S JUST PLAY
I NEEDED AN EDUCATION
NOW I'M READY FOR MY ENERGY
I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH THE
DID I GET MY UPGRADE
WE MUST ADOPT THAT WAY OF GIVING BACK
THAT DOESN'T PROBLEM MAPPLE EVERY DAY
IF ANY CHILD IS FOUND VIOLATING THESE RULES HE IS SEVERELY REPRIMANDED
EFFECTIVELY THE THARIBAN CREATE A COMPLETE BLACKOUT OF ANY OTHER SOURCE OF INFORMATION
THEIR PARENTS ARE SO POOR THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GET THEM BACK
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE A
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
IT TURNS OUT THE EVIDENCE SAYS OTHERWISE
NONE OF THESE STUDIES FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND MORE ON DRINKING OR SMOKING OR THAT PEOPLE
IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA RIGHT
IT IS THE DEFAULT OPTION
WE JUST GREW THE WAY
YOU'RE MORE CAUTIOUS
AND YOU WALK AROUND AND IT POINTS TO THINGS
THAT IS GREAT
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
SO WHY IS IT
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE WASHING THEIR HANDS
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS AT YOUR
DID YOU LEARN TO WASH YOUR HANDS IN SCHOOL
BUT I LOVE IT FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON
THEY MAKE SENSE OF THE PAST
THREE BILLION PEOPLE TODAY WITH CELL PHONES CAN'T ACCESS INTERNET
DON'T CREATE SOLUTIONS TO IMPRESS CUSTOMERS
WE HARVARD BIAS
WE KNOW THAT WE ARE RIGHT AND THEY ARE WRONG
WELL THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE WALKING SPEED OF A MAN IN A VIDEO FOR EXAMPLE YOUR ANSWER
HARDEST SURGEONAL STRENGTH
LOOK AT THE END OF SEE THE ANIMAL
JUST THINK ABOUT IT
BUT IT'S A GLOBAL PHENOMENON
ONE BILLION PEOPLE
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO APPRECIATE
SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER
SHE NEVER HAD TO DUCK AND COVER UNDER HER DESK AT SCHOOL
BUT BEFORE THAT COOPERATION COULD BE REALIZED KENNEDY WAS ASSASSINATED AND THAT PART OF THE
BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT DATE FOR ANOTHER REASON
HAVE INSPIRED A GENERATION OF INNOVATORS
I'M A DOCTOR
BUT TOO OFTEN MY TREATMENTS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW
WHO CLEANS UP AFTER US
I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW THEM AS INDIVIDUALS
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHO TAKES THE JOB
SO I STARTED A RESEARCH PROJECT WITH ME
IT WAS A REMARKABLE PRIVILEGE AND AN AMAZING EDUCATION
THE ECONOMY NEEDS THEM
TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU
CAN YOU SIGN HERE RIGHT NOW
WHY DOES THE JELLYFISH I MET LIGHT
OR A FIREFLY
AND THAT'S POWERFUL
I KNOW HOW MUCH
IT'S MORE ANNOYING
IT GOES WRONG
I COULDN'T CARE MYSELF AWAY FROM RECOVERED
AND OTHERS RESENTED THIS COMPARISON BETWEEN GAY RIGHTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS AND
AND THIS WASN'T JUST AN ABSTRACT QUESTION
AFRICAN AMERICANS SUPPORTED IT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN HAD EVER BEEN RECORDED
CAN WE REALLY SCALE THIS UP
EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE WEARS OUT
AND THAT BLEW MY MIND
THEY DON'T HAVE MEANING
YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WORK
YOU ARE A HEALER IN A STONE AGED VILLAGE
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY DIDN'T COME OUT
AND SO IT'S PERFECT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WE NEED TO SEE BEYOND THE SURFACE
THERE WILL BE A SINGLE MOMENT IN THE SCHEDULE
NOW MY OWN SPECIALITIES COMBINING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IN MAGIC
I AM SICK TO MY STOMACH
HOW DO WE KNOW FOR SURE
WE CREATED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST
I'M THE OPPOSITE
THEN SHE GETS THE BOSSES TO RATE HOW CREATIVE AND INNOVATIVE THEY ARE
SO PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THIS STUDY AND THEY'RE GREAT IF I WANT TO GET BETTER BY JOB I JUST NEED TO UPGRADE MY BROWSER
THEY KNOW YOU CAN FAIL BY STARTING A BUSINESS THAT GOES BAKER MORE BY NAILING TO START A BUSINESS AT ALL
THEY HAVE THAT IDEAS
THAT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
SO I WENT IN THAT DIRECTION
THIS IS A CRISIS THAT'S GETTING WORSE DAY BY DAY
SO THE ANSWER TO THE SECOND QUESTION CAN WE CHANGE
WE NOW HAVE A MORAL CHALLENGE THAT IS IN THE TRADITION OF OTHERS THAT WE HAVE
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED IS THAT APPARENTLY IT MATTERS IF A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS
BUT THAT'S KIND OF A BIG PROBLEM
AND ALL OF THAT SOUNDS BREAK UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE IT'S REALLY GOING
I JUST DISAGREE WITH THIS
LIKE WE EVOLVED ON THIS PLANET IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS WITH WHICH WE SHARE
AND SO I THINK THAT NATURE IS NOT THAT WHICH IS UNTOUCHED BY HUMANITY MAN OR WOMAN
I WANT TO GO
I WAS LIKE OH THE AMAZON
THEY'D GROW CROPS
THERE'S PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND THIS IS CRAZY
AND I'M SURE THE FIGURES ARE SIMILAR IN OTHER COUNTRIES
EVERY KID LIVES NEAR NATURE
WE'VE JUST SOMEHOW FORGOTTEN HOW TO SEE IT
THERE'S POLLINATION GOING ON
WE ARE NOW VERY COMFORTABLE IMAGINING UNIMAGINABLE TECHNOLOGICAL ACHIEVEMENT
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SAVING THE WORLD
MOST OF MY FRIENDS WOULD TAKE A JAPANESE
SO I THOUGHT WHY NOT PUNISH MYSELF
I WAS ALWAYS VERY SMALL
SO WATER WAS SOMETHING THAT SCARED ME TO BEGIN WITH
BUT I WOULD GO IN ON OCCASION
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE GREAT FUN
AND THIS ROUTINE WENT ON FOR SOME TIME
I TRIED EVERYTHING
AND THIS BECAME MY HOLY GRILL MY ROSETTA STONE
AND NOW I LOVE LANGUAGES
AND NOTHING WOULD
AND THEN I THOUGHT THIS GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
WELL I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA I
OUR CITY COULDN'T POSSIBLY HANDLE ANYMORE CARS
I HAD TO HAVE FAITH
IT WOULD BE INVOLVED AND NOT PART
IS ABOUT EARNING AS MUCH AS IMPOSSIBLE TABLE
HOW SHOULD WE WORK
HOW SHOULD WE LIVE
WE NEED PORTABLE HEALTH BENEFITS
I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DO THAT
WE NEED TO REINVENT LABOR ORGANIZING
THEY WANT TO BE PART OF IT
AND THEY SAY I WANT TO WORK IN GLOBAL POCKETS BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN ABOUT MY CAREER
THERE'S A FLIP SIDE AS WELL
IT'S SHOCKING TO REALIZE THAT ONLY 28 PERCENT OF AMERICAN
HOW DO YOU GET INFORMED
WE PAID TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
THERE'S NO MORE UP
LET'S GO BACK AND VISIT OUR EQUATION
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO T
EVEN IF WE GET EVERYBODY WORKING ON IT WE'VE GOT THE BEAST TO TEACH IT
SO WE DID THE ANALYSIS AGAIN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY
SO IT'S THE DEMAND THAT BRINGS THEM TO PROTECT
SUSTAINABILITY HAS GOT TO BE A PRECOMPETITIVE ISSUE
AND MY WHOLE WORLD DID OPEN HAPPEN
AND WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT
WE NOW HAVE A PLATFORM
IT REALLY IS QUITE PHENOMENAL
THAT WAS POWERFUL
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD
RAISE YOUR HAND
TAKE MY CHILD
I BELIEVE A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
SHE WORKED IN A BANK
I HAVE TO REPORT IT
HE CARES ABOUT BOSNIANS
WHICH INCINNALLY IS ONLY A THIRD CORRECT AND
I DON'T MEAN GIVING UP THE INTERNET
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ME
MAKE IT GO AWAY IT
MAKE IT GO AWAY
MAKE IT AWAY
WE CAN'T IDENTIFY WITH THAT PART
YOU MIGHT GET IN PEACE FOR THAT
WELL NOT YET
WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE A BREEDING GROUND FOR COMPASSION
SO WAS MOTHER TOURISTS AT
THAT IS SOME DEEP DEEP EMOTION WHEN YOU'RE NOT TO DO ABOUT
WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF THESE HORSES
WELL GUESS WHAT
NOW I KNOW WHY I'M HERE
AND I WAS REALLY SCARED
THE IRONY IS SO OBVIOUS RIGHT
AND ABOUT A FOUND ONE
THEY WANT TO GET OUT
ALLOW MANY PEOPLE TO COME IN
LET US HAVE A HONG KONG ON YOUR BODY
WHEN WE SHARE IDEAS WE ALL GET MORE
SO IT'S MORE ABOUT CAPTURING AN IDEA THAN ABOUT CAPTURING A MOMENT DREAM
IT'S ABOUT SYSTEMS
THIS IS ABOUT EQUALITY
I STARTED LOOKING AT THE MOON CAREFULLY
I LOOKED AT MY FRIENDS WHO DRILLED SEVEN DRY WELLS WRITING OFF MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE
THESE GUYS COULD BE TRUE TO THEIR PURPOSE WHICH WAS FINDING BOIL AND GAS
AND THEY WERE BASICALLY HAVING FUN
WE NEED TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY TO SURVIVE
IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE THEM PART OF OUR RATIONAL DECISION
WE ALL KNOW THE INSIDE WHAT THE ANSWER IS
WE'VE KNOWN SINCE WE WERE BABIES
WE GO OUT THERE AND WE HOP IN OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE
WHERE ARE THE RESEARCHERS LEARNING
SO I WAS JEALOUS I
I KNOW I DID IT
I THINK I'M A NORMAL PERSON
THAT'S LIKE FINDING AN EXTRA HOUR IN THE DAY
YET WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND SEVEN HOURS BECAUSE THERE IS WATER ALL OVER HER BASEMENT SHE FOUND
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT
BUT YOU CAN WRITE IT
YOU SAY YOU'RE WORKING MORE THAN 60 HOURS
WELL ARE YOU SURE
AND THAT'S EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKING WAY MORE THAN FULL TIME HOURS
WE DON'T EVEN NEED THAT MUCH TIME TO DO AMAZING THINGS
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING SCARCE TO HELP THEM
THANKS VERY MUCH
WHY WERE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CONNECTION WITH EVERY SINGLE PAINTING
HE ALSO HAD 11 CHILDREN
NOT THE WIFE NOT THE KIDS
I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH
PLEASE LOOK AT ME
WHO IS GOING TO INHERIT HIS NAME AND HIS FORTUNE
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
NOT RIGHT NOW
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE EXTREMELY MAD
BUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE FEATURES COME AT A COST
HOW COULD WE GET SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT OF SO LITTLE MOTION
WE WOULD JUST GET NOISE BACK
WE PUSH AND POOL AND POKE AND BROAD THINGS
HOW DO YOU FIND A DINOSAUR
THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
BUT WE ONLY GET ONE HISTORY AS THE MOMENT WE HAVE
BUT THIS PARTICULAR REALITY WAS NOT INEVITABLE
COME ON MAN
WE WERE WRONG
NOW THAT'S A VERY VERY GOOD POINT
YOU SMELL MONEY
WE WERE THE FOLLOWING THINGS
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
WHAT CAN I LEARN WITH YOU
AND ONE ACTIVIST ACTUALLY FOUND A CONTRACT FROM A WESTERN COMPANY FOR THE SALE OF SURVEILLANCE
I DON'T CARE
AT WHAT POINT DID I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA
SHE SAID YEAH NO
WHY DID YOU BRING THIS UP
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND
I'M A FIFTH GENERATION TEXAN
IT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHUT PEOPLE DOWN ON AN AIRPLANE
WHAT DO YOU DO
I STUDY SHAME I
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING DOING IT RIGHT NOW
YOUR WIFE LAST YEAR
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
HE ASKED WHAT DO WOMEN NEED TO DO TO CONFORM TO FEMALE NORMS THE
I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE HARDEST WORKING
I WAS A MEDIOCRE STUDENT
BUT HAS NEVER HAPPENED
I WAS THE FIRST NON FAMILY INVESTOR IN HIS OWN
THIS IS NONSENSE
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME TO SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES OF PAIN AND AGONY AND SHAME
AND WHEN SHE WENT TO COMPLAIN TO A MAJOR HE SAID WHAT
AGAIN IN A CAR
I WAS PETRIFIED
SEXUAL HARASSMENT DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE
NOT A LOT OF HANDS
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME WITNESSES OR DEPOSITIONS
THEY JUST DO IT
SO WE NEED THE SOLUTIONS AND THESE PEOPLE GAIN THE GAME THEY ARE TRYING OUT
AND WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT KIND OF STORY BEFORE
NOW DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT
THAT WOULD NOT WORK
AND AFTER THAT INITIAL PROTOTYPE WE SET OUT TO MAKE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SO THAT OTHERS DO NOT HAVE
AND THEN GUESS WHAT
COULD WE LEVERAGE THE CLOUD
SO WHY DON'T WE LEVERAGE THAT
AND I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT BECAUSE I EXPECTED ONE OF THESE
THEY HAVE SOCIAL MEANING
THEY WERE UNEXPECTED PLEASURES
SOMETIMES IT GOES FARTHER
OR WHERE'S HE LEFT
STRANGERS MIGHT ASK EACH OTHER FOR A SIP OF WATER
AND THIS LEADS TO AUDITIES
BUT THIS IS THE SOURCE OF INNOVATION
WELL WHY IS THAT
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN A
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IT TALK ABOUT JURY SIGN FEL
I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE JUST COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF THEM
WELL WHAT DIFFERES DOES THIS MAKE A
AND SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT COPYING THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT TO GET THEM TO THRIVE
WHAT MAKES THE HEART UNIQUE
I LOVED THE BACK
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS
THIS IS NOT A PUT DOWN OF ANYONE
IT IS WRONG
IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE AND
ARE WE BRAVE ENOUGH TO WELCOME IT
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT
THERE'S NO STRUCTURE
GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS A 20 YEAR INVESTMENT
WHEN YOU GROW UP FOUR YOU WANT TO BE RICH
HOW COULD I WALK THEM DOWN
SOMETIMES IT'S MESSAY AND IT'S ALWAYS UNPREDICTABLE
ABOUT A YEAR AFTER 9 11 RESEARCHERS EXAMINED A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE WORLD
I TEACH THAT STAFF HERD
AND THE PHYSICIAN PRACTICING WITH CUTTING ISH TECHNOLOGY
WE'RE LOSING OUR RICH FOR
THIS WAS WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS
THEY HAD HER SCANNED INSIDE OUT
I WOULD LISTEN TO THE HEART
AFTER ALL I WASN'T BIT UNCONVENTIONAL
I'VE STRUGGLED TO SAY THOSE WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY THEM
WHAT IF I HAD TOLD HER MY STORY YEARS AGO
SO YOU WANT TO GO BACK MORE LIVING BUT YOU ONLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE THINGS THAT INTEREST
THAT ROBOT PUT ON A GREAT SHOW
WE ALMOST DON'T FEEL OURSELVES
SO WHAT DO WE DO
WE CONNECT MORE AND MORE
WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE WHO THEY ARE
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING FOR HERE NOW
DO THE SAME THING AT WORK
IT'S PRETTY COLD
WE HAVE THE PLAN
BUT IF THEY DON'T STAY IN PARIS THE INTERNATIONAL OPPRESSION WILL BE OVERWHELMING
WE MIGHT SAY THEN WELL LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS
WOMAN'S DAY WAS COMING UP
WELL LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT THOUGHT FOR JUST A MINUTE
AND WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT
IT'S A LETTING STUFF HAPPEN WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT
YOU'VE BROKEN YOUR BACK
YOU'LL NEVER WALK AGAIN
IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF JOKE MAIL TO BE THROWN AWAY
GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY HOW PEOPLE CHANGED
THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
SHE NEVER WANTED TO TELL ME
MY PARENTS CAME FROM GERMANY
SOME OF THEM WERE REALLY AFRAID OF CONTAGION AND THEY WOULDN'T EVEN WALK IN FRONT OF OUR
SO WHAT WAS I GOING TO DO
CONSTANTS BAKER MODELY
THAT IS THE RIGHT ANSWER
AND WORKED LIKE A DOLL
THAT'S YOUR BRAND FATHER
TELL ME ABOUT THAT
AND THAT'S ALL
THEY WERE ALL QUITE
SO THEY FELT SAFE TO COME THERE
WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROGRAM
I TELL YOU WHAT TOGETHER
I MAY NEVER GO TO YOUR HOUSE YOU MAY NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
I BECAME A PSYCHOLOGIST OF SEARCHER AND I COULD VOTE IN MY WORK TO UNDERSTANDING THE HUMAN CAPACITY TO CARE FOR OTHERS
AND IT IS IMPORTANTLY
WITHOUT IT WE LITERALLY CAN'T INTERFACE WITH OTHERS
MY HISTORY WASN'T RIGHT
MY DESIRE TO DISAPPEAR WAS STILL VERY POWERFUL
I TAKE IT TO THERAPY
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
HE'S AT A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE AND FLORIDA
YOU PROBABLY WON'T
NOR DO I THINK WE ARE BY OURSELVES ACTUALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
MOST OF THE PENET MEDIA WAS SHUT DOWN
WE HAVE TO FIX THE INTERNET
WE HAVE TO FIX OUR EDUCATION
IT SHOWED NO BLOCKAGES
BUT LINDA WAS LUCKY
SHE FOUND US WE FOUND HER DISEASE
BUT FOR TOO MANY WOMEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE
THE AUTHORS LOOKED AT PAPERS WRITTEN OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD AND HUNDREDS HAD TO BE PRONOUN
WE KNOW THAT EVERY CELL HAS A SEX
WE HAVE THE TOOLS BUT WE LACK THE COLLECTIVE WILL AND MOMENTUM
AND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE QUALITY AND THE INTEGRITY OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
WE HAD DRAWN A BLANK AND IT WASN'T JUST IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
WE HAVE IDEAS FOR HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND I WANT TO SHARE THREE OF THEM THAT WE'VE PICKED UP IN OUR OWN WORK
I DO BELIEVE WE CAN FIX WHAT'S BROKEN
WE ALL WANT TO
THAT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM AT THE HAITI EARTHQUAKE
WE LOST VALUABLE DATA
IT'S ABOUT THE DATA
I CAN HARDLY WAIT
WHY DID MY CHILD DEVELOP AUTISM
THEY WERE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
THIS IS POSSIBLE
THE WORLD'S COMPANIES GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS HAVE DELIVERY ARMIES THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF COVERING THIS
AND IN MANY CASES WE DON'T
BUT WE ALL SHOULD
THIS WILL PAY DIVIDENCE
I FEEL THAT I'VE KNOWN FOR
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST STAY HOME
THE CHOICES DON'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE IT'S THE WRONG QUESTION
SO WE DECIDED TO GO TO THE MOSQUE
I KNOW IT WORKS
BUT I GREW UP IN CANADA FAR FROM MY ARAB ROUTES
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THEIR FAMILIES OFTEN TOO WEALTHY ARAB TOURISTS
THIS IS JUST ONE FACE OF A BOOMING SEX TRADE ACROSS THE ARAB REGION
SOCIAL CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE ARAB REGION THROUGH DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION
WE'RE NOT PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER
THERE'S A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS TO EAT PEA SO
IF WE'RE STILL HUNGRY WE MIGHT HAVE SUBMORT
ALL OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF TRIBES
YOU DON'T WANT THIS
THIS IS A BIT OF A DIFFICULT DIMENSE TO PUT UP ON THE SCREEN
AND I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT AS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY WE NEED TO
IF YOU WANT THIS EXPERIENCE TO LIVE ON AS SOMETHING HISTORIC THEN AT THE RECEPTION
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE YET
IT COMES OUT OF A PLACE CALLED THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION
YOU KNOW THEY DO POLES RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY ELSE WHO GOES POLICE
SO I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THESE THOUGHTS
THEY COULD GEL US
BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WE'RE NOT AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN YET
THERE WAS NO ROADMAP IN
IN FACT SOUTH AFRICA HAS NOT GONE DOWN THAT ROAD
LIFE IS GREAT
WHAT ABOUT MARTIN LOSER KING
AND HE GREW UP ESSENTIALLY IN STAGE ONE
MY LIFE REALLY SOCKS
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
BUT I DON'T
YOU'RE HEARING ONE PRESENTATION AFTER ANOTHER OFTEN REPRESENTING A GROUP OF PEOPLE TO TRY ABOUT HOW
AND YOU DON'T LEAVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE
I WAS GOING THROUGH A HARD TIME AS WELL
I WAS LIKE WHAT
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING ANY QUARTERS BECAUSE THE WASHER AND DRYER ARE FREE
LOOK AT THESE PREDE STRUCTURES
HAS A COHERENT MOVEMENT
THAT'S NOT AN IMPROV OF A SOLUTION
YOU CAN NAVIGATE SPATIAL
YOU KNOW ABOUT NUMBER
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE
HOW IS THAT COURSE OF THE
WHY NOT JUST THAT BUSINESSES CAN BE
STARTED TO WALK IN THE COMMUNITY AND IT DIDN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO REALIZE THAT THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS
THEY NEED SUPPORT
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN
AT THE SAME TIME
IT'S A FUCKING AUTUMN
HOW IS IT MADE
WHY WAS IT MANAGED
THEY FEEL AT HOME
